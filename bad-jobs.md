**I AM _ABSOLUTELY NOT OPEN TO:_**
<br/>❌ **RELOCATION**\*;
<br/>❌ **"PERMANENT" JOBS**;
<br/>❌ **FULL-TIME WORK** (over 30 hours/week);
<br/>❌ **ON-SITE WORK**\*;

**SENDING ME ADS FOR ANY OF THESE KINDS OF WORK,
OR FOR ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES,
INCLUDING FRANCHISES,
CONSTITUTES ENGAGING MY SERVICES FOR
[EVALUATION OF YOUR ADVERTISEMENT](ad-eval).**

The fee is US$100 base,
plus $100 per link I must follow for sufficient information,
plus $1 per word in the original message or at such links,
all times however many of the above prohibited factors apply.&nbsp;
Payment is due one calendar month after my reply,
with a late-fee of 1.5% per calendar month, non-compounded.

(My actual limits on most of these are even stricter,
to the point where the limits shown above
are _so_ outside the pale
as to constitute unquestionable spam.)

\* Light travel is OK,
up to one trip per month,
lasting up to one week,
including travel time.
