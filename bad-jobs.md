**I AM _ABSOLUTELY NOT OPEN TO:_**
<br/>❌ **RELOCATION**\*,
<br/>❌ **"PERMANENT" JOBS**,
<br/>❌ **FULL-TIME WORK** (over 30 hours/week),
<br/>❌ **ON-SITE WORK**\*,
<br/>❌ **TWO-DIGIT HOURLY RATES**,
<br/>❌ **FRONT-END-HEAVY WORK** (over 50%),
<br/>❌ **JUNIOR-LEVEL WORK** (needing less than five years total experience),
<br/>❌ **"CLEARED" WORK**,
<br/>❌ **SYSTEM/NETWORK/ETC. ADMIN WORK**, OR
<br/>❌ **SWITCHING INTO A NON-TECH CAREER**!

(My actual limits on most of these are even stricter,
to the point where the limits shown above
are _so_ outside the pale
as to constitute unquestionable spam.)

\* Light travel is OK,
up to one trip per month,
lasting up to one week,
including travel time.
