**I am _absolutely not open to_:**
- relocation (though light travel is ok);
- full-time work in the sense of "permanent";
- full-time work in the sense of about 40 hours per week;
- junior-level work (experience requirement under five years);
- two-digit hourly rates;
- working mainly on-site;
- working mainly on the front-end;
- working mainly in the Java ecosystem;
- working mainly in the .NET ecosystem;
- working mainly on Windows;
- switching into QA;
- switching into network, Sharepoint, system, or any similar kind of admin work;
- switching into a non-tech career!

(My actual limits on most of these are even stricter,
to the point where the limits shown above
are _so_ outside the pale
as to constitute unquestionable spam.&nbsp;
For the ones phrased as "mainly",
I will tolerate _some_ of each aspect,
such as 20% front-end work &mdash;
but approach 50% at your own peril.)

Sending me ads for any of these kinds of work,
or for _any_ products or services,
without my prior written approval,
constitutes engaging my services for
[evaluation of your advertisement](ad-eval).&nbsp;
The fee is
US$1 per word,
plus $100 per link I must follow for sufficient information,
_all times however many of the above factors apply!_

For example, a
"permanent",
40-hr/wk,
junior-level,
network admin job,
on-site,
in Kansas,
using Windows,
for a "total compensation package" worth around $150,000
(which means about $75 an hour),
would mean that the rate per word
is _multiplied_ by eight,
meaning $8 _per word_.

Payment is due
one calendar month
after my reply,
with a late-fee of
1.5% per
calendar month,
non-compounded.
