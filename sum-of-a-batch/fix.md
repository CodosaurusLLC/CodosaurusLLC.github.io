So you made a batch of mead, it's all done fermenting,
and you don't like how it turned out.&nbsp;
Oh well.&nbsp;
No biggie, we've all been there, many times.&nbsp;
The question now is, what to do about it?

(If it's just plain nasty,
not jet-fuel nasty which just usually means it's too dry or needs aging,
but _raw sewage_ nasty, that _probably_ means it's infected.&nbsp;
In that case it's probably a total loss, and
you need to pour it down the drain and
_thoroughly_ disinfect _any_ equipment that came in contact with it.&nbsp;
But I'm going to address less _tragic_, more _rescuable_ reasons,
many of which are just matters of personal taste.)

Of course, this depends on _why_ you didn't like it.&nbsp;
The most common reasons are in the table below.&nbsp;
If you have some mead available with the opposite problem,
or at least firmly enough into the middle to fix by blending,
you can blend the two together.&nbsp;
(To predict how that will turn out, see
<a href="/sum-of-a-batch/blend.html">the blending calculator</a>.)

Other than that, in general,
if it's too weak you'll have to add more honey and let it ferment more,
if it's too strong you'll have to dilute it,
if it's too dry you'll have to add more honey
(or something else sweet)
_than will be fermented_,
and if it's too sweet you can dilute, cut, or make it ferment more.

<h3>Too Sweet And Weak</h3>

If your mead is too sweet and too weak,
you can put in some yeast with a higher alcohol tolerance.&nbsp;
The new yeast will chew through some of the sugars
that your old yeast couldn't, fixing both problems.

(I did this myself when I first tried making
[Joe's Ancient Orange Mead](https://gotmead.com/blog/recipe/joes-ancient-orange-clove-and-cinnamon-mead/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
following the recipe straight off the web site.&nbsp;
I didn't like how sweet it turned out, so I added some
Mangrove Jack M05, which brought the SG down from 1.04-something
to a much more drinkable 1.020.)

<a name="sweet"></a>
<h3>Just Too Sweet</h3>

If your mead is too sweet but you like the strength,
you can put in something to cut the sweetness, like lemon juice.

Caveat: raising the volume (without adding alcohol) will lower the ABV,
so if the yeast went dormant because of alcohol,
they may wake up and start fermenting again.&nbsp;
This could _also_ help cut down on the sweetness,
but you'll need to be sure to use an airlock.&nbsp;
If you _don't want_ further fermentation,
such as if you're bottling,
then you should probably cold-crash, rack, and stabilize it
before adding anything.

<a name="sweetstrong"></a>
<h3>Too Sweet And Strong</h3>

If your mead is too sweet _and_ too strong,
you can simply dilute it.&nbsp;
The tricky part is whether the same dilution that gets you
a sweetness you like,
will also get you a strength you like,
or vice-versa.&nbsp;
You _could_ try diluting to solve one aspect,
see how you like the result,
and if the other aspect is still bad, go back to the table.

To predict how that will turn out, see
<a href="/sum-of-a-batch/blend.html">the blending calculator</a>.&nbsp;
You can use that to blend batches of mead,
_or_ blend mead with plain water or honey.

Once again, though, since this will lower the ABV,
the yeast may wake up and continue fermenting.&nbsp;
If you are fine with this, just be sure to use an airlock.&nbsp;
Otherwise, cold-crash, rack, and stabilize.

<a name="weak"></a>
<h3>Just Too Weak</h3>

If your mead is too weak but you like the sweetness,
you can add some more honey
_and_ some more alcohol-resistant yeast.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp;
Most likely, your yeast hit its alcohol tolerance,
leaving a good amount of sugars in the must.&nbsp;
(If it didn't hit its tolerance, there must be some other reason
why there are sugars left.)&nbsp;
If that's the case, then
just adding more honey will make it sweeter, not stronger.&nbsp;
Just adding more resistant yeast will make it stronger,
but do so by removing some of the sugars, making it drier.

To predict how that will turn out, go to
<a href="/sum-of-a-batch/plan.html">the batch planning calculator</a>,
and plug in the full final volume of water and weight of honey,
and the alcohol resistance of the yeast.

<a name="strong"></a>
<h3>Just Too Strong</h3>

If your mead is too strong but you like the sweetness,
dilute it to your desired ABV and add honey to your desired sweetness.&nbsp;
You may need to repeat that process multiple times.&nbsp;
Diluting it will cut the strength _and_ the sweetness,
so you need to add some honey to get the sweetness back up.

Once again, though, since this will lower the ABV
(which in this case is the main point),
the yeast may wake up and continue fermenting.&nbsp;
If you are fine with this, just be sure to use an airlock.&nbsp;
Otherwise, cold-crash, rack, and stabilize.

To predict how just diluting and sweetening it will turn out, see
<a href="/sum-of-a-batch/blend.html">the blending calculator</a>.&nbsp;
You can use that to blend batches of mead,
_or_ blend mead with plain water or honey.

To predict how diluting it _and fermenting it more_ will turn out, go to
<a href="/sum-of-a-batch/plan.html">the batch planning calculator</a>,
and plug in the full final volume of water and weight of honey,
and the alcohol resistance of the yeast.

<h3>Too Dry And Weak</h3>

If your mead is too dry and weak,
add more honey and let it keep fermenting.&nbsp;
You _may_ also need to add a more alcohol-resistant yeast,
if it's hit the ABV tolerance of your original yeast.

(I did this myself, when I made a batch of sima,
a weak Finnish lemon mead,
that I didn't realize was supposed to be
drunk before it was finished fermenting!&nbsp;
It ran dry, down to 0.996 SG at about 5% ABV.&nbsp;
I added two more pounds of honey, and a second clove, and let it rip.&nbsp;
It's still bubbling as of this writing, so.... &lt;shrug/&gt;)

To predict how it will turn out, go to
<a href="/sum-of-a-batch/plan.html">the batch planning calculator</a>,
and plug in the full final volume of water and weight of honey,
and the alcohol resistance of the yeast.

<a name="dry"></a>
<h3>Just Too Dry</h3>

If your mead is too dry but you like the strength,
you can cold-crash, rack, stabilize, and back-sweeten it,
with your choice of sweetenings.&nbsp;
This is in fact how quite a lot of mead is made, on purpose.&nbsp;
Just be aware that anything you add will lower the ABV,
so maybe make it actually a pinch stronger than you want it in the end.

<a name="drystrong"></a>
<h3>Too Dry And Strong</h3>

If your mead is too dry and too strong, you can dilute it.&nbsp;
Of course this will cut the strength, but also,
if your SG was under 1.000 this will make it less dry.&nbsp;
If it's still too dry (quite likely, as 1.000 is still quite dry),
you can add some more honey.&nbsp;

Caveat: raising the volume (without adding alcohol) will lower the ABV,
so if the yeast went dormant because of alcohol,
they may wake up and start fermenting again.&nbsp;
This could make it even drier!&nbsp;
So, you probably want to cold-crash, rack, and stabilize it
before adding anything.&nbsp;
Or, you could deliberately let it keep fermenting.

To predict how just diluting and sweetening it will turn out, see
<a href="/sum-of-a-batch/blend.html">the blending calculator</a>.&nbsp;
You can use that to blend batches of mead,
_or_ blend mead with plain water or honey.

To predict how diluting it _and fermenting it more_,
with or without more honey,
will turn out, go to
<a href="/sum-of-a-batch/plan.html">the batch planning calculator</a>,
and plug in the full final volume of water and weight of honey,
and the alcohol resistance of the yeast.
