I want to analyze
(i.e., know the percent alcohol of)
a batch of mead.
</p>

<p>
Its Specific Gravity went from<br/>
<input type="text" id="OG" autofocus>
(the Original Gravity, or "OG")<br/>
down to<br/>
<input type="text" id="FG">
(the Final Gravity, or "FG").
</p>

<p class="small">
(If you didn't take an OG reading, you can use
<a href="plan.html">the batch <i>planning</i> page</a>
to guesstimate it.)
</p>

<button onClick="mead_analyze()">Calculate!</button>

<div id="results"></div>

<p class="small">
To do the math yourself,
you can divide the "drop" (OG minus FG) by 0.00762,
or multiply by 131.24,
rounding to however may digits you like.&nbsp;
Multiplying the drop by 130,
or dividing the drop <i>in thousandths</i> (aka "points") by 7,
are very common approximations
that you might be able to do quickly in your head.
