  <p>
  I want to analyze
  (i.e., know the percent alcohol of)
  a batch of mead.
  </p>

  <p>
  Its Specific Gravity went from<br/>
  <input type="text" id="OG" autofocus>
  (the Original Gravity, or "OG")<br/>
  down to<br/>
  <input type="text" id="FG">
  (the Final Gravity, or "FG").
  </p>

  <p class="small">
  (If you didn't take an OG reading, you can use
  <a href="plan.html">the batch <i>planning</i> page</a>
  to guesstimate it.)
  </p>

  <button onClick="mead_analyze()">Calculate!</button>
</div>

<div id="results"></div>

<p class="small">
To quickly guesstimate it in your head,
you can divide the "drop" (OG minus FG) by 0.00762,
or multiply by 131.24,
rounding to however may digits you like.&nbsp;
Dividing the drop in thousandths (aka "points") by 7
is a very common approximation.&nbsp;
This page, however, uses a much more complex formula,
that accounts for some differences that show up
at the high and low ends.&nbsp;
(However, it does not take <i>temperature</i> into account.)

Thanks to Michael Hall and Zymurgy Magazine for the formula.&nbsp;
