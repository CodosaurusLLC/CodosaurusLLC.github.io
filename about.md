who am I?

I am Dave Aronson,
a semi-retired software development consultant
(meaning I write code _and_ give advice about how),
with professional experience dating back to 1983,
in a wide variety of languages, systems, techniques, and domains.&nbsp;
Since 2011,
I've mostly been doing
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
and before that, mostly (plain old) C.&nbsp;
The rest of it has been in many other languages,
most notably Python, SQL, and the nearly-inescapable JavaScript.&nbsp;
(And _many_ older or more obscure ones I won't mention here,
lest they attract the wrong recruiters.)&nbsp;
Now I'm trying to break into
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
having been learning it on and off for several years,
including some open source contributions,
but I haven't landed any _paid_ work in it yet.

I first started freelancing in 1990,
having had my third layoff.&nbsp;
In the pre-web days,
both work and I were _much_ harder to find.&nbsp;
So, almost three years later,
I went back to the "real job" world,
though I did occasional freelance projects
on evenings, weekends, and between "permanent" positions.&nbsp;
In 2009, I _finally_ managed to land a job that would
get me real-world experience in "modern" languages
(including two I had taught myself over the years,
and another I learned as "post-interview homework").&nbsp;
In 2011, I wanted to get more experience particularly in Ruby,
and felt that freelancing was the best way to do that,
so I tried that again &mdash;
and this time it has worked much better!&nbsp;
;-)

Aside from actual hands-on software development,
I also enjoy [speaking at conferences](speaking),
especially in interesting places
where I can take a few extra days to play tourist.&nbsp;
(The picture above is from
[JSConf Hawai'i](https://www.jsconfhi.com/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
2020.)&nbsp;
Relatedly, I also maintain the
CfP (Call for Papers/Presentations/Proposals) list
for the Speakers Network within the
[Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#accept-only-candid-coders){:target="_new"}
consulting network.&nbsp;
(Please use that link to hire or join them,
the anchor is my referral tag.)

On personal notes:&nbsp;
I am married to a smart cutie who doesn't like publicity,
so no more details there.&nbsp;
We live in
[City of Fairfax, VA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fairfax,+Virginia/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
(a suburb of Washington, DC),
and are owned by two cats.&nbsp;
In my spare time,
I make
[mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
maintain
[a website about it](https://www.SumOfABatch.com/){:target="_new"},
record
[videos about making mead simply](https://www.SumOfABatch.com/videos){:target="_new"},
and run [workshops to teach that](https://www.SumOfABatch.com/workshops){:target="_new"}.
