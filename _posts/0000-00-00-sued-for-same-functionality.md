title: Can you be sued for providing the same functionality?
---

Once again I waxed verbose on Quora, answering:

> [If someone wrote a software program from scratch that has all the similar functions of proprietary software, but with their own original code, can they be sued?](https://www.quora.com/If-someone-wrote-a-software-program-from-scratch-that-has-all-the-similar-functions-of-proprietary-software-but-with-their-own-original-code-can-they-be-sued/answer/Dave-Aronson){:target="_new"}

and wanted to preserve my answer here on my own "property", so:

`===8<---cut-here---`

First, an important disclaimer:
I am not now, nor have I ever been,
a member of the lawyering profession.&nbsp;
Take everything herein with a large sack of salt,
and follow this advice at your own risk.&nbsp;
Now:

Technically, in many countries, anybody can sue anybody for anything.&nbsp;
Whether they’d *win* is a different question.&nbsp;
That may sound facetious but it is a very important distinction,
as even *being sued unsuccessfully* can really ruin your year.

In this particular case,
suppose I wrote a complete replacement for, say, PowerPoint, from scratch.&nbsp;
I would *fully expect* to be sued by Microsoft.&nbsp;
At the very least, they would abuse their vast resources to try to
grind me down,
prevent people from using my program instead of theirs,
keep me from enjoying the fruits of my labors,
and "teach me a lesson" not to intrude on their "turf".&nbsp;
(Well, at least I would expect it from
MS as it was run by Gates or Ballmer.&nbsp;
Nadella would probably be much nicer about it,
but there’s still a significant risk.)

Even if they lose, it’s just a cost of doing business,
just like all those lawsuits and fines and such they’ve paid in the past.&nbsp;
Even if we were in one of the more sensible countries,
where the loser has to pay the costs of a lawsuit,
which puts a *bit* of a damper on frivolous or abusive lawsuits,
my full costs *plus* theirs,
and even any reasonable amount I could *countersue* for, successfully,
would not even be pocket-change,
not even *couch-cushion* change,
to Microsoft.&nbsp;
If Microsoft were walking along the street
and saw that much money just sitting on the ground,
it wouldn’t be worth their time to stop to pick it up.

Now, would they *win*?&nbsp;
On the parts most people would think of,
the *code itself*,
obviously not.&nbsp;
I wouldn’t even have *access* (so to speak) to their proprietary code,
so as to be able to plagiarize it.

But then there’s "look and feel".&nbsp;
If any of those features my program has in common with PP,
could fall under the umbrella of "look and feel",
or a unique non-obvious workflow,
or anything else MS could legitimately claim to have invented
and I could easily see just by *using* PP,
then they *may* have a legitimate claim!&nbsp;
In *some* countries and at *some* times,
such things have been considered legitimate IP (Intellectual Property).&nbsp;
You haven’t filled out your profile,
so I can’t tell if this applies to you where you are.&nbsp;
They may have actually taken out a patent (or other such legal protection)
on such things,
or they may be able to make a valid IP claim
without such paperwork done in advance.

So: provide the same *functionality* (ideally more),
but make it *look and feel* different,
and don’t copy their workflows and such
except where it’s either a common standard or an obvious thing to do,
and you *should* be *relatively* safe against *justifiable* lawsuits.
