You may have seen
[my announcements about conferences looking for speakers](/speaking/cfps-ending-soon).&nbsp;
You may have wondered how I keep an eye on so many.&nbsp;
The answer is mostly that
I use a tool I wrote, to check web pages for changes.&nbsp;
That tool operates from the command-line,
but I've been in the process of making a web version . . .
that is now online!

[WWWizzzard.com](https://www.WWWizzzard.com){:target="_new"}
("it checks the WWW while you ZZZ!")
lets you specify what web pages you want it to check,
how often, and a few other options.&nbsp;
A basic level of usage is free,
and more will be available for a reasonable price in the near future.

Please try it out, and let me know
any problems you have with it,
any further features you think would be useful for your use-case
(but please see
[the Plans page](https://www.WWWizzzard.com/plans){:target="_new"}
first),
and what that use-case is.

Thanks!
