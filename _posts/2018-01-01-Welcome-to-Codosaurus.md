Greetings, dear readers!&nbsp;
This is a relaunch of my coding blog,
into which I will _also_ merge my "personal excellence" blog.&nbsp;

Now it's your turn.&nbsp;
What advice would you
seasoned programmers, engineers, developers,
or whatever you call yourselves,
give to today's up-and-comers?&nbsp;
What questions would you ask of _me_?&nbsp;
What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
