title: Upcoming Speaking Engagements
---

It occurred to me that I haven't been
publicizing my upcoming speaking engagements very well.&nbsp;
Sure they're listed on my
[speaking page](/speaking),
but I haven't been notfiying my
RSS-based followers.&nbsp;
So, I'm going to try to keep this post up to date.

### Latest Definite Speaking Engagements:
