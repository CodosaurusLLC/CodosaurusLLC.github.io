Another one from an inquiry &mdash;
not exactly a question,
and not on Quora.

A developer with several years of experience,
let's call them MJ,
sent me a message on LinkedIn:

> Hi I am M&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; J&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;<br>
> Ruby on Rails (RoR) Developer, NextJs Developer, Full-Stack Developer
>

Notice anything missing?&nbsp;
_Aside_ from the first letter of almost every sentence!&nbsp;
(The first letter of each link was also not "linkified".)

It was also missing any clue of
WTF they wanted me to _do_ with this info!&nbsp;
Of course they probably wanted to know if I
had any appropriate job openings at my company,
but just in case there was something more realistic, I replied:

> And . . . ?

To which they replied:

> I'm looking for a remote Ruby on Rails job

Which prompted my reply:

> And you think sending me your credentials will help because . . . ?

Them:

> If you have any opportunity regarding this please let me know (Edited)

Me:

> If I have any opportunity, meaning, at my company?

Them:

> Yeh in your company or you know other opportunities regarding ROR job

And now we finally get to the bits that _you_,
dear reader,
may find helpful.&nbsp; ;-)

===8<&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;cut here&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;

No, but I will help you in other ways.&nbsp;
First, I see you are looking to connect.&nbsp;
I accept most connections from fellow techies.&nbsp;
This will raise your visibility to lots of
recruiters, executives, and other techies.

Second, advice:

1)&nbsp; Ask for what you want.&nbsp;
Some cultures call this rude,
but it's even ruder to
waste the other person's time
making them guess what you want.

2)&nbsp; Be concise.

3)&nbsp; Do your homework before sending a company a job inquiry.&nbsp;
Sending them an inappropriate job inquiry can
wreck your chances of getting a job there,
or anywhere else that may find out about it.

4)&nbsp; Watch the correctness of what you send,
including the spelling, formatting, etc.&nbsp;
Some subtle errors are okay, nobody's perfect,
but having many obvious errors makes you look sloppy.

5)&nbsp; Find ways to make yourself stand out.&nbsp;
Tell companies what you've done _that others haven't_.&nbsp;
If you don't have any such things, start thinking of some and doing them.

6)&nbsp; Related to the above, go beyond the mere technical skills.&nbsp;
Train up on communication, leadership, mentorship, teaching, business,
and so on.&nbsp;
Look at what the people on the next few rungs of the ladder above you do,
both the technical and other skills, and learn those.

7)&nbsp; Find ways to stand out, even aside from the jobhunt.&nbsp;
You never know who might stumble across a post
(blog, LinkedIn, group, whatever),
newletter article, conference presentation,
open-source project (or at least contribution),
or other content you've produced &mdash;
plus, they give you something to point to, in the jobhunt.

That's it for now.&nbsp;
I'm off to turn this exchange into a blog post.&nbsp;
(See #7.)
