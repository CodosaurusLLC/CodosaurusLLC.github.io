title: Is Cracked Software Safe for a While?
---

Another one from a Quora question:

> [IMAC users, I want to install cracked software for designing, is it safe for a while before I buy the original software on the official website?](https://www.quora.com/IMAC-users-I-want-to-install-cracked-software-for-designing-is-it-safe-for-a-while-before-I-buy-the-original-software-on-the-official-website/answer/Dave-Aronson){:target="_new"}

**NO!**&nbsp;
Cracked software,
or things pretending to be that,
is one of the biggest malware vectors,
especially on Macs.&nbsp;
This isn’t something that’s
more of a risk the longer you run it;
when you install
what you downloaded off some sketchy site,
you have installed malware
right then and there.&nbsp;
Most of these will
do their dirty work
immediately,
since they don’t want to
risk that you won’t use it again.&nbsp;
(Against,
partly because often
it isn’t at all
what it says on the tin.)

Buck up and
pay for the commercial package,
find a free alternative,
write your own,
do without,
or have someone else do the work for you
(again probably for pay).
