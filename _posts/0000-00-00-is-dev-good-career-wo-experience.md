title: Is development a good career for people with no experience?
---

Another one from Quora
(look in the _comments_,
'cuz for whatever reason
it wouldn't show me
the box to write an _answer_):

> [Is software development a good career for people with no experience?](https://swet.quora.com/Is-software-development-a-good-career-for-people-with-no-experience){:target="_new"}

Every career has to accept
people with no experience at the start,
as we’re not born with experience in anything.&nbsp;
So I’m going to ass-u-me you mean something like
"is it a career where
a lack of experience
is less of a disadvantage than usual".

And yes, yes it is.&nbsp;
A career in software development
requires that you be
continuously learning new things.&nbsp;
If you do that,
a developer with experience in general
_but not in what you just learned_
will have far less advantage over you.

For better or worse,
most employers want to hire people with
experience in the specific tech stack they’re using &mdash;
it’s a running joke that
they demand ten years of experience in
something invented last week.&nbsp;
Among more enlightened employers,
who believe that people can learn things on the job,
the one with more general experience
will still have a bit of an edge over you &mdash;
neither of you have experience in the specific tech stack
but the other has more experience
and therefore will probably learn the new thing faster.

However,
"enlightened employers"
are few and far between.&nbsp;
All the more so when
you stick third-party recruiters in the mix &mdash;
generally speaking,
they are even more clueless about the technology
than the hiring company’s managers or HR staff,
and do nothing more than
tick off a list of boxes
based on a nearly literal string match
of terms they don’t understand.

It’s also one of the few fields where
you can gain [what enlightened people would consider]
significant experience on your own.&nbsp;
You can do your own side projects,
or contribute to open source projects.&nbsp;
These and blogging are
great ways to show that you actually do know something,
even if you haven’t been paid to do it yet.
