title: Worry about Scalability or Popularity First?
---

Another one that started as a Quora question:

> [In developing a brand new software product,
> should you worry about scalability right from the start,
> or wait to see if the product is actually popular first?](https://gauravgaur.quora.com/In-developing-a-brand-new-software-product-should-you-worry-about-scalability-right-from-the-start-or-wait-to-see-if-t){:target="_new"}

Absolutely worry first about whether your product will be popular!&nbsp;
(And likewise for a service, and whether it’s software or something else.)

If your software isn’t popular, you won’t *ever* need scalability.&nbsp;
All the time you spend worrying about scalability first
will just delay you from *finding out* whether it’s popular.&nbsp;
That delay might be enough for some competitor to
beat you to the market and
establish enough of a foothold that *your* entry will flop,&nbsp;
even if it *would* have succeeded if it got there first.

Put out an MVP ASAP,
even if it’s horribly unmaintainable and unscalable!&nbsp;
Chances are very high that you’re going to pivot to another idea,
rewrite the software, or totally fail anyway.&nbsp;
And even if your product is popular,
it’s extremely difficult to figure out
how much scalability you’ll actually need.

This is one of the reasons why I describe the ideal clients
for my software process/tools/etc. advisory service
as "established" (among other factors),
by which I mean either they’ve been in business for at least a year
or they’re turning a profit, preferably both.&nbsp;
By this time they’ve figured out what people really want,
and are ready to get serious about the "ilities"
like scalability, maintainability, and so on.&nbsp;
Before then, the focus needs to be on speed to market,
and other ways of determining "product/market fit".
