So what does it mean, in **ACRUMEN**{:class="acrumen"} terms,
for a piece of software to be **U**{:class="acrumen"}sable?

If we Google that term,
we usually come up with things about
making sure that users with various _challenges_
can use the system as well as the rest of us.&nbsp;
That's a great goal in itself,
but I'm adding on that it should be
easy for _everyone_ to use,
not just _equally difficult!_&nbsp;
To go into a bit more depth,
it should be _clear_ at all times,
what the user _must_, _should_, or _can_ do,
especially any _help_ facilities
(including _documentation_, even if _printed_) &mdash;
and those things should be _easy_ for the user to _find_ and _do_,
despite any (reasonable) _challenges_ they may be facing.

In terms of making it easy for end-users of a program,
this is actually the hardest one, for most of us geeks.&nbsp;
Fortunately, we can get a lot of help from
various other professions.&nbsp;
Mainly we want User Experience experts,
but User Interface experts are almost as good.&nbsp;
Designers can help a lot too,
and it's usually a lot easier and cheaper to hire them.&nbsp;
Once again, though, we can go a long way with their mindset,
and in particular some basic design principles,
especially the KISS principle.&nbsp;
You may have heard of that applied to code,
but if not, it means
"**K**{:class="big"}eep **I**{:class="big"}t **S**{:class="big"}imple, **S**{:class="big"}tupid!",
or if you don't want to be so negative,
"**K**{:class="big"}eep **I**{:class="big"}t **S**{:class="big"}uper-**S**{:class="big"}imple".&nbsp;
Even an
[Information Architect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
can help lay out our site or program or whatever in a logical hierarchy,
but that's something we geeks are usually pretty good at in the first place.

Another often-overlooked part of **U**{:class="acrumen"}sability is
that it's not just for end-users
of software with a graphical interface!&nbsp;
Not just web, mobile, or desktop apps,
but also other things such as
_command-line_ apps,
and APIs,
whether they work via _function calls_
(like with a typical library or framework),
or passing _binary_ messages over a wire or pipe or whatever,
or passing _textual_ messages.
