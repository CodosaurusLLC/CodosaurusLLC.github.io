title: Talk Released &mdash; in Portuguese!
---

It also occurred to me that I haven't been publicizing it well here,
when one of my conference talks gets released!&nbsp;
So, I'm going to try to remember to do that,
and to kick things off:

My talk from
[GambiConf 2023](https://gambiconf.dev){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"}
has just been released.&nbsp;
It wasn't one of the usual ones,
on Mutation Testing, Genetic Algorithms, or even
[my ACRUMEN definition of software quality](/acrumen){:target="_blank"},
but a new one,
about a little tool I wrote to
quickly and easily generate a version of a talk,
based on including or excluding various pieces.&nbsp;
These pieces could be for instance
different version of the introduction
(like ones in English, French, Portuguese, Klingon, etc.),
different code examples
(like ones in Elixir, Ruby, Python, Brainfuck, etc.),
different ways to explain something
(like long, medium, and short versions),
and so on.

The talk is on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJtFPdvBcj8){:target="_blank"},
but . . . it's in Portuguese!&nbsp;
(No, I don't mean it was dubbed or subtitled,
I _wrote_ it from scratch, and delivered it, in Portuguese.)

The tool it's about is on
[Github](https://github.com/CodosaurusLLC/Genaver){:target="_blank"} &mdash;
but don't worry, the docs, code comments, etc. are in English.  ;-)

You can catch up on some of my past talks at
https://www.Codosaur.us/speaking/past &mdash;
many, though not all, have links for the slides and/or video.
