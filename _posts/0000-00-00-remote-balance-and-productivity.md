title: Remote Work/Life Balance and Productivity
---

Another one from Quora:

> [How can remote software engineers maintain a healthy work-life balance while staying productive?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-remote-software-engineers-maintain-a-healthy-work-life-balance-while-staying-productive/answer/Dave-Aronson){:target="_new"}

Generally speaking, _much_ more easily than in-office software engineers!

Not having to commute means they have
lower work-related demands on their time.&nbsp;
For many people,
it also means omitting
a particularly stressful and dangerous part of the workday,
one that actually _costs_ them money
that is rarely reimbursed by the employer.&nbsp;
For that matter,
remote workers often don't even have to put on "real clothes",
versus a bathrobe or pajamas or even nothing at all,
saving them further time and expense.&nbsp;
;-)

But what about the productivity, you ask?

For this kind of work,
or anything else involving a lot of deep thinking on complex matters,
working remotely generally means fewer distractions,
so they can get into a state of "flow"
rather than having to constantly rebuild their mental models
after numerous interruptions.&nbsp;
Yes, the snacks in the pantry and the nice weather outside may be calling,
but those are much more easily ignored (with a bit of self-discipline)
than the colleagues and bosses wandering by with questions,
or wanting to go out to lunch or play ping-pong or whatever,
not to mention their noisy chatter
even when you're not part of the conversation.&nbsp;
If there are kids or inquisitive pets or whatever at home,
there's the option of working from
a local library or coffeeshop or whatever.&nbsp;
(Though then they'd be expected to put on "real clothes" again.&nbsp;
;-) )

Sure, there may be occasional need for
discussion with colleagues, clients, etc.&nbsp;
The vast majority of this can be handled asynchronously,
like via email, or for more people, chat systems such as Slack.&nbsp;
If synchronous discussion is needed,
there's always the phone, or if worst comes to worst (IMHO), texting.

So, to sum up, the way your question is phrased
makes me think that _you_ think it's difficult,
but by contrast,
the lower time-demands and lesser distractions
make remote work a big win for
any kind of work involving concentration on complex systems.
