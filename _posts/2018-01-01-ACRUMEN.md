I've always prided myself on the _quality_ of my software.&nbsp;
So have a lot of other people and companies.&nbsp;
But . . . what does that even _mean_?&nbsp;

We toss the word "quality" around very loosely,
not only in the software development field but most others too.&nbsp;
Ask two developers, get three opinions.&nbsp;
There seems to be no commonly accepted
definition of software quality,
let alone one I agree with.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp;
We seem to operate more on a basis of
"I'll know it when I see it",
though more like "when I _don't_ see it".

So I set about coming up with one.&nbsp;
I wanted somthing
easily to remember
(so as to spread it),
technology-agnostic,
yet pretty much comprehensive.

What I've come up with is
something I call ACRUMEN.&nbsp;
This is of course an acronym,
standing for the ideas that
software should be:

- **Appropriate**{:class="acrumen"}: doing what all the stakeholders need it to do,
  i.e., doing the _right job_
- **Correct**{:class="acrumen"}: that's pretty obviously doing the _job right_
- **Robust**{:class="acrumen"}: hard to make it _malfunction_ or even _seem_ to
  (yeah, that's kinda fuzzy, I'll explain more in another post)
- **Usable**{:class="acrumen"}: easy for the intended users to use
- **Maintainable**{:class="acrumen"}: easy for developers to change
- **Efficient**{:class="acrumen"}: easy on resources (technical _and other_)

So what's the N stand for?&nbsp;
**N**othing,
I just tacked that on to make a real word.&nbsp; ;-)
But you probably haven't seen this word before,
mainly because it's not English.&nbsp;
It's Latin for "sour fruit", such as citrus fruits.&nbsp;
That's why lemon yellow is
the "official color" of **ACRUMEN**{:class="acrumen"}.
