<p>I offer the following services
(click on each title for details):</p>

<div class="card">
  <p><b><big><a href="/services/roadmaps">Roadmaps</a></big></b>

  This gives you
  <i>clarity</i> on what you need
  and how to get there,
  saving you time (and therefore money).&nbsp;
  Even if you outsource the project,
  a roadmap can help you select a vendor,
  and help the vendor know what to do.</p>

  to help your team
  quickly write
  high-quality software
  that meets the needs of your users.</p>
