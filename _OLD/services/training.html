  This page is
  in the process of
  being updated
  due to
  the COVID pandemic

  my semi-retirement.

<p>
I offer training classes,
that I can come to your location to teach,
or do remotely via the Web.&nbsp;
Rather than languages, frameworks, and other common things,
I mainly teach
how to produce high-quality software,
using
<a href="/ACRUMEN">the ACRUMEN Software Quality Definition</a>.&nbsp;
I can also teach on
"modern" software engineering techniques
conducive to quality,
such as

<p>
These are currently available only in half-day length,
and at premises you arrange,
which must have proper presentation facilities.&nbsp;
Later I may expand these into
full-day or multi-day,
or make them available via webinar,
or maybe even recordings,
if there is demand.
</p>

<p>
Pricing, <i>without customization</i>,
is $199 per seat
or a flate rate of $3,399,
plus travel expenses.&nbsp;
There is a minimum of ten and a maximum of twenty students
<i>at this rate</i>.&nbsp;
I'm willing to negotiate about larger classes,
but they will be either much more expensive,
or done much less interactively.&nbsp;
You can have <i>fewer</i> students, but
you'll pay for the extra seats,
and there are
<i>no refunds for no-shows</i>
(regardless of reserved size).
</p>

<p>
A 50% deposit is due
at least three weeks
before the class.&nbsp;
The other half
(plus expenses)
is due 20 days after the class.&nbsp;
There are penalties for late payment
and
discounts for early payment.
</p>

<p>
If you want me to customize a course
to address your specific needs,
such as having examples in your chosen language,
working up a training class in something else,
or expanding a class into a full day or more,
I can do that... for a price.&nbsp;
Discounts are also available if you want
multiple classes on the same day,
or multiple consecutive full days.
</p>

<p>
Note that just as with all my other on-site services,
classes <i>must</i> be booked for
at least as long as
the required travel
(round-trip, door to door),
and there are
penalties for late payment
and
discounts for early payment.&nbsp;
At least in this case, you have many options how to put that together.&nbsp;
;-)
</p>

<p>I am also in the process of putting together
downloadable videos, e-books, and other training material
that can be used at your own leisure.&nbsp;
Some will even be <i>free!</i></p>
