title: Roadmap Info
---

In order to start getting a handle on
how much time we'll need to spend
[roadmapping your project](/services/roadmaps),
I need you to send me a lot of information.&nbsp;
Please [send me an email](/contact)
with as much of the following information as you can,
and anything else you think would be useful:

- What are you trying to _achieve?_

- Why?&nbsp;
What is the _business_ value of the project?&nbsp;
What would define _success_ of this project?

- What _alternatives_ have you considered?&nbsp;
Why did you reject those?

- Why do you want to do it _now_,
as opposed to earlier, later, or even _never?_

- Have you _tried_ this before, or anything _else_ like it,
or see anyone _else_ do so?&nbsp;
How did _that_ go?

- What steps, resources, etc., do you _think_ are involved,
including labor and budget?&nbsp;
What _evidence_ do you have for this?&nbsp;
What are your _data_ and _reasoning?_

- What parts of the above resources do you already _have?_&nbsp;
Do you have a plan in place to _get_ the rest?&nbsp;
Or is that _part_ of what you need planned?

- Do you have a particular _technology_ in mind,
or other such constraints?&nbsp;
Why do these constraints _exist?_&nbsp;
How _strong_ are they?

- How soon do you need the _project_ done, and _why?_

- How soon do you need the _roadmap_ done, and _why?_

<!--
- Are you okay with talking about it _remotely_,
or do you want me to come to your office,
or do you have some "neutral zone" in mind,
or what?
-->

- Tell me more about _you_.&nbsp;
What is your history and expertise in software development,
and in the _domain_ your challenge is in?

- Who else will I be talking to, if known?&nbsp;
Tell me those details about them too.

- What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
