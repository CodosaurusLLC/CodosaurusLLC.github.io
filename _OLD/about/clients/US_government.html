<h3>Who are they?</h3>

<p>This is really
just a <i>piece</i>
of the
United States federal government.&nbsp;
No, it's not one of those whose operations are normally top-secret
or anything like that.&nbsp;
However, they don't like it being known
that any given person works for them
(including consultants).&nbsp;
I will only mention that they are
a former client from when I was employed at
<a href="http://www.baesystems.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  BAE Systems</a>,
doing fairly similar work.&nbsp;
I made a good impression on them,
and kept in touch over the years,
and when they had some suitable work,
they contacted me.</p>

<p>To cut through a lot of the red tape inherent in government contracting,
I am working as a subcontractor through
a fairly large government contractor,
who <i>also</i> prefers to avoid the spotlight.&nbsp;
So, all I will say about <i>them</i> is that
they're not one of the big famous ones most people would recognize,
but enough that people in the business would recognize them.</p>


<h3>What am I doing, when, where?</h3>

<p>I have been working for them since January 2016,
on a project to update a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-domain_solution"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  cross-domain</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Assurance_Guard"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  High Assurance Guard</a>
adding a traffic monitoring dashboard,
adapting it to new message types,
adding other features,
fixing bugs,
etc.&nbsp;
I've also come up with,
and implemented,
further labor-saving or quality-enhancing ideas,
like a translator from
<a href="http://www.corba.org/omg_idl.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  OMG IDL</a>
to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  YAML</a>
(which they had been doing manually!),
and scripts to run several quality-analysis tools on the codebase.&nbsp;
I am not only writing code,
but also advising on processes, tools, standards, and other such matters,
helping define the features and such for
similar upcoming projects,
and mentoring junior developers.&nbsp;
You're not going to get much further detail here,
as they also don't like the <i>work</i> being discussed publicly either.</p>

<p>The work has been about 98% remote so far --
everything but
a few local meetings,
a few trips of a few days each,
and a few days of pairing (near me) with a junior developer.</p>


<h3>What am I using?</h3>

<p>Technologies, techniques, tools, etc. I used there included:</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org" rel="nofollow" target="_new">Ruby</a>,
    though not on Rails;
    I turned one piece into a
    <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">Sinatra</a>
    app,
    but most of it does not have a web interface
  </li>

  <li>
    Reading an occasional bit of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)"
       rel="nofollow" target="_new">
      C</a>,
    but no writing it yet
  </li>

  <li>
    There might be some

      Rust</a>
