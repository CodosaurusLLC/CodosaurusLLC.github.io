<h3>Who are they?</h3>

<p>
Liqwid Networks no longer exists.&nbsp;
It <i>was</i> a tiny firm,
headquartered in Arlington, VA,
making software for
"Real-Time Enterprise Computing and Communications (RTEC2) technology".
</p>

<h3>What did I do, when, where?</h3>

<p>
I worked there from June through August 2004,
and January through March 2005,
on a project they were doing for Anteon,
a small government contracting firm
that <i>also</i> no longer exists.&nbsp;
(They are now part of
<a href="http://www.generaldynamics.com" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  General Dynamics</a>.)&nbsp;
Initially this was through KSI Staffing
(who, as you may have guessed, also no longer exists),
but later directly.
</p>

<p>
The work involved LiqwidWAM, which was essentially an SMS group messaging
system, whereby users could sign up, create groups, join and leave groups, and
send messages to groups.&nbsp; (Like 
<a href= "https://groups.yahoo.com/neo" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  Yahoo Groups</a>,
except nowhere near so feature-rich, you sign up
with a mobile phone number instead of an email address, and so far all messages
had to be entered via the web.)&nbsp; It was being funded and rebranded by
Anteon as SIRIXS (<b>S</b>ecure <b>I</b>nfrastructure for <b>R</b>apid
<b>I</b>nformation e<b>X</b>change <b>S</b>olution), for use by
first-responders.&nbsp;
You might have even spotted the branded SUV
at their Springfield, VA office.
</p>

<p>
My main task in 2004 was to implement features and fix bugs, mostly onsite
at Anteon (in Springfield, VA).&nbsp; For instance, I added, among many other
features:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Configuring various things in the UI (site name, logo, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Sending email to individual users, not just groups
  </li>
  <li>
    Uploading a file of new users (as an admin)
  </li>
  <li>
    Forwarding a message, to users or groups
  </li>
  <li>
    Optional automatic deletion of forwarded messages
  </li>
  <li>
    Automatic emails to admin and new user when a new user signs up
  </li>
  <li>
    Monitoring users' WAM email addresses for messages to forward, using
    <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol"
       rel="nofollow" target="_new">
      IMAP</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Generating more reports
  </li>
  <li>
    More intuitive screen-flow
  </li>
  <li>
    Assorted security restrictions</i>
  </li>
  <li>
    Assorted robustness
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
I also roadmapped (detailed and prioritized)
future feature additions;
refactored code for clarity, robustness, and efficiency;
updated the documentation;
and
provided support to our primary beta client
(<a href= "https://www.newyorkcares.org"
  rel="nofollow" target="_new">New York Cares</a>).&nbsp;
In 2005, I also hosted the server at my own house,
and did some liaising with ISGroup,
a company attempting to integrate LiqwidWAM with
their collaboration platform.&nbsp;
(They <i>also</i> seem not to exist any more.)
