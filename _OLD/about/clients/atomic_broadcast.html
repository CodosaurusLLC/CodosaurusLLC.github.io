<h3>Who are they?</h3>

<p>
Atomic Broadcast no longer exists.&nbsp;
It <i>was</i> a <i>very</i> early-stage startup,
with an idea about some social media filtering.&nbsp;
(No I won't tell you more.)&nbsp;
There was, as far as I know, only the founder,
and no code written before me.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
Also, this was my first Rails freelancing gig!&nbsp; :-)
</p>

<h3>What did I do, when, where?</h3>

<p>
I created a tiny Rails app for them with one feature:
retrieval of a user's tweets from Twitter, via the Twitter API.&nbsp;
This may sound trivial, but it was <i>supposed</i> to be a "test drive",
possibly leading to later work if things worked out
<i>and</i> he got funding for the rest of his idea.&nbsp;
I did this in under the four hours allotted, in December 2011, 100% remotely.
