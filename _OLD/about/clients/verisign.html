<h3>Who are they?</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.verisign.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  Verisign</a>,
based in Reston, Virginia, USA,
is one of the primary companies that
make the Internet work.&nbsp;
Among other things,
they take care of many of the most important
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registry"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  domain name registries</a>
-- they are not merely a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_registrar"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">registr<i>ar</i></a>,
 (though they do that too),
 but the people the registrars <i>depend</i> on.&nbsp;
 They run the registries for
 .com, .net, .tv, .cc, .name, .jobs, .edu, and .gov,
 plus two of the thirteen
 <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_name_server"
    rel="nofollow" target="_new">
   global root name servers</a>.&nbsp;
 They also provide
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack"
    rel="nofollow" target="_new">
   DDOS protection</a>,
 <a href="https://www.verisign.com/en_US/security-services/dns-management/index.xhtml"
    rel="nofollow" target="_new">
   managed DNS</a>,
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
   malware</a>
 detection,
 and other defensive services.&nbsp;
 If you know much about the Internet, you know Verisign!
</p>

<h3>What did I do, when, where?</h3>

<p>
My initial task was to
investigate the feasibility of
migrating a Rails 4 app
from using
<a href="http://www.mysql.com" rel="nofollow" target="_new">MySQL</a>
to
<a href="http://basho.com/products/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">Riak</a>,
a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  "NoSQL"</a>
database.&nbsp;
That proved to be infeasible --
at least, for a complete migration,
and a partial migration would not have served their purpose.&nbsp;
So, I also investigated migrating it to
<a href="http://www.nuodb.com" rel="nofollow" target="_new">NuoDB</a>,
a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewSQL" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  "NewSQL"</a>
database.&nbsp;
That too proved infeasible -- at least, at this time,
given the state of tools for using NuoDB with Rails.
</p>

<p>
During that time, the management decided that
everything they built should have an API.&nbsp;
(When you do things at their scale,
the separate deployability that enables makes a lot of sense.)&nbsp;
My mission then became to take this app and split it into
an API half, and a UI half that would depend on it.&nbsp;
I designed and implement a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  RESTful</a>
API, using a Rails server, tailored to the needs of the UI half,
which a Verisign employee was to create (with help from me).&nbsp;
The API was a typical straightforward REST type,
plus a few twists
(such as adding some endpoints that would delete some subparts en masse,
and that "create" and "update" were combined into an "upsert"),
with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  HATEOAS</a>
links in
<a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  HAL</a>
style.&nbsp;
I also updated the Python and Java tools that were
using the existing non-RESTful API,
and of course the tests, in RSpec and Cucumber.&nbsp;
However, shortly after I had gotten the general concept working in two halves,
they decided to abandon further development for the moment.
</p>

<p>
Sorry, I can't reveal much details of the app,
but I can say that it was intended to be used as a platform
on which others can build services.&nbsp;
That plan has been abandoned,
but Verisign is still considering
building some of their <i>own</i> new services on it.&nbsp;
As of now, it is running, but not accessible from outside Verisign,
so you can't see the UI half nor explore the API.
</p>

<p>
On top of all that, I helped out on other projects,
when someone needed some brief advice on Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Cucumber, etc.,
or general techniques of development or testing.&nbsp;
Also, a friend of mine had been hired as a contractor in another department
(he went permanent soon thereafter), and I helped him teach our colleagues Ruby,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  pair programming</a>,
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  TDD (test-driven development)</a>.&nbsp;
We had great fun demonstrating "smart-@$$ ping-pong pair programming".&nbsp;
;-)
</p>

<p>
I worked there from June 2013 to February 2014
(six month initial contract plus three month extension),
in The Hive (their tiny elite R&amp;D Innovation Lab group in Reston, VA),
via <a href="http://www.celerity.com" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  Celerity IT</a>.&nbsp;
I was mostly onsite, which I didn't mind because the commute was reasonable --
and I liked the offerings at the subsidized cafeteria, and the restaurants of
<a href="http://www.restontowncenter.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  Reston Town Center</a>.&nbsp;
;-)&nbsp;
After a while, they allowed me to work remote when I liked,
which wound up being about 40%.
</p>

<h3>What did they say?</h3>

<div class="quote">Thanks very much, Dave, for all of your contributions
  over the past months.&nbsp; We've enjoyed having you as part of the Hive!</div>
