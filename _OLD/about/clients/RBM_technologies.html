<h3>Who are they?</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.rbmtechnologies.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  RBM Technologies</a>,
based in Cambridge (a suburb of Boston), Massachusetts, USA,
provides sales floor planning
SaaS (Software as a Service)
to large companies with many consumer-serving locations,
in the consumer retail/services space.</p>

<h3>What did I do, when, where?</h3>

<p>My contract with RBM
started in February 2015 and
was originally anticipated to run for about three to six months,
via
<a href="https://www.toptal.com/#accept-only-candid-coders"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  Toptal</a>,
and actually lasted about nine
(stopping in November to take the
<a href="/about/clients/US_government">
  US Government</a>
contract).&nbsp;
My main tasks were
to make enhancements and bugfixes in two systems.&nbsp;
All work was 100% remote.</p>

<p>The first system
supports an API to
answer queries
sent in a
JSON-based custom query language,
and sends the results in JSON.&nbsp;
It is intended for use <i>by</i> the second system,
to reduce the time it takes to answer these queries
from about half an hour
(sounds crazy, but that's what they said!)
to a couple seconds.&nbsp;
(We were aiming for half a second,
and <i>most</i> known queries quickly became that fast.&nbsp;
However, a few took up to a couple seconds.&nbsp;
We agreed that
the extra effort to
speed up the few slow ones
would not be worthwhile.)&nbsp;
For this one, I:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Made it
    understand and answer
    many more types of queries,
    and in a "cleaner" and more extensible way.&nbsp;
    (It was
    composing a massive SQL string.&nbsp;
    I made it
    use ActiveRecord.&nbsp;
    We planned to
    move eventually
    to ARel,
    in order to get "or" capability.&nbsp;
    That was put on hold
    once the Rails team announced
    that ActiveRecord 5 would include that.)</li>

  <li>Extended its ability to
    store, modify, and delete objects
    in response to object-change notifications
    received over RabbitMQ.&nbsp;
    Previously it only stored certain columns,
    whose meanings were the same for all clients,
    and were therefore stored in normal database columns
    for this program.&nbsp;
    I made it store
    attributes whose meanings <i>varied</i> by client,
    and objects' memberships in
    custom hierarchies
    decided by the client.&nbsp;
    The custom ("ad-hoc") attributes
    were stored in PostgreSQL HSTOREs,
    and the hierarchies in a tree fashion using the Ancestry gem.
    Both were wrapped in 
    additional layers to enable
    constraining a search to
    a particular timeframe.</li>

  <li>Added an "options" endpoint
    that returns
    the names and values for assorted options, including
    those ad-hoc attributes and custom hierarchies.</li>

  <li>Added the ability to download query results in CSV format.</li>

  <li>Added the ability to
    allow fixture types to "act as" another type,
    so that when the latter is
    queried, the former is included.</li>

  <li>Added the ability to
    allow the client to
    ask for "sets" of certain types of fixtures,
    by designating that
    fixtures of a given type
    "count as"
    some fraction of a full fixture.&nbsp;
    This also worked in reverse,
    allowing the client to
    designate that
    fixtures of a given type
    "count as"
    some <i>number</i> of complete fixtures.</li>

  <li>Made it use the other program's database <i>directly</i>,
    instead of its own summarized copy,
    negating the prior need for
    special treatment of
    client-varying attributes,
    custom groupings,
    receiving item updates over RabbitMQ,
    the "options" endpoint,
    and other complications.</li>

  <li>That in turn required
    modifying the multi-tenancy arrangement,
    from switching <i>schemas</i> to switching <i>entire databases</i>
    (albeit not <i>servers</i>),
    even though we were still using PostgreSQL,
    which does support separate schemas.</li>

  <li>Made it use the other program's <i>tables</i> directly,
    rather than a <i>view</i>
    as done previously,
    which was severely impacting performance,
    as proven when I:</li>

  <li>Wrote a program to
    create and benchmark
    queries done various different ways
    (such as with a view involving many tables
    versus joining tables only as needed),
    and used it to create benchmark spreadsheets.</li>

  <li>Unified the different kinds of queries into one,
    reducing redundancy in
    both the "production" codebase and the test suite.</li>

  <li>Updated Capistrano deployment process and files.</li>

  <li>Removed multi-tenancy,
    opting to have one installation per client,
    not sharing any more.</li>

  <li>Helped define several new syntax parts for the query language.</li>

  <li>Helped define new request authentication process.</li>

  <li>Fixed some bugs affecting development and testing.</li>

  <li>Fixed a bug preventing referrer-based authentication in cases where the
    tenant database name did not follow a strict assumption made by prior
    developers, which was impossible to follow in the test lab environment.</li>

  <li>Fixed a bug creating different cache keys for searches with identical
    parameters just mentioned in a different order.</li>

  <li>Made it
    an <i>engine</i>
    to be used inside the other program,
    including <i>down</i>grading from Rails 4.2 to 3.0,
    resolving other conflicts,
    and packaging it as a gem.</li>

</ul>

<p>
The second one is
their "flagship" application,
under constant active development
by a large-ish team.&nbsp;
I worked on it while they had some
decisions to make
about the first one.&nbsp;
This one is for
planning
floor layouts for
chains of
retail sales stores
and other such
consumer service centers,
such as
banks,
big-box retailers,
and
cellphone stores.&nbsp;
For this one, I:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Made it filter a list of "planograms"
    (arrangements of content on fixtures)
    according to
    what category or more specific type of merchandise they're about,
    what sales campaign they were last updated in,
    and/or
    how that update was done.</li>

  <li>Added an icon and highlighting to planograms with unseen changes
    in that same list,
    and let users filter and sort by that status.</li>

  <li>Removed those markings
    when a user
    clicks on the planogram
    in the list,
    to load it into the editor,
    unless the user has certain "stealth" permissions.
  </li>

  <li>Added an approval checkbox
    to the planograms in that list,
    including
    making adding/removing approval
    also mark it as "seen",
    unless the user has certain "stealth" permissions.
  </li>

  <li>Changed which fields were imported,
    and some calculations from those fields,
    during CSV import processing.
  </li>

  <li>Made some reports
    exclude lines about
    locations outside of
    chosen campaign
    or
    chosen location filter
    (they were previously cluttered with all locations).</li>

  <li>Made ingestion of client data feed
    add
    some more data
    to the names of
    automatically created filters.&nbsp;
    Also made it more efficient,
    by creating filters for
    only the combinations of certain factors
    that were actually used in the current file,
    not <i>all possible</i> combinations.</li>

  <li>Found and fixed a bug
    removing too many options from a dynamic list
    matching only a string typed by the user.</li>

  <li>Found and analyzed (someone else then fixed) a bug
    in the search for
    sales content arrangements left over from prior sales campaigns.</li>

  <li>Found root cause of a bug
    preventing customer admins from performing certain actions;
    can't claim credit for the fix because it was a data problem,
    to be solved by other means.</li>

  <li>Fixed bug
    yielding incorrect counts of
    how many copies
    each location
    had of
    a given piece of content
    for a given sales campaign.</li>

</ul>

<p>I also advised on matters of coding style, tools, and process, such as
ticket granularity,
ticket state definitions,
and what to test in what way.</p>


<h3>What did they say?</h3>

<div class="quote">
  Dave joined our team and made an immediate and tangible contribution
  enhancing and extending a back-end Rails service.&nbsp; He took on complex
  work, completed tasks with confidence and quality, and worked well both with
  our current team and independently.&nbsp; I would go back to Dave for any RoR
  server side work without hesitation.
