<h3>Who are they?</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://homeactions.net" rel="nofollow" target="_new">Home Actions</a>,
based in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, DC, USA
(but with widely distributed staff),
provides real estate agents assorted tools
to manage and increase their business,
primarily a system to manage newsletter subscribers, content, layout, etc.
</p>

<h3>What did I do, when, where?</h3>

<p>
I worked for
<a href="http://homeactions.net" rel="nofollow" target="_new">Home Actions</a>,
100% remotely, for about two weeks in 2013.&nbsp;
The short length was due to being about to start
a much longer-term full-time contract for another client.&nbsp;
They alotted me 60 hours to accomplish the initial goal,
but I did that so quickly, they gave me more work to do.
</p>

<p>
The <i>initial</i> goal was to enable their system to retrieve
their clients' contacts from assorted cloud-based email providers.&nbsp;
I did this for GMail and Yahoo! by using the OmniContacts gem,
including extending it to retrieve street addresses
(and submitting the patches upstream like a good Open Source netizen).&nbsp;
I did it for AOL and Hotmail via .csv upload.
</p>

<p>
In addition, I made the importation happen in the background
(so that the user wouldn't have to wait),
fixed several bugs,
refactored the code to make it easier to add further email providers,
and gave them advice on how to use
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  TDD (test-driven development)</a>
to prevent bugs and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  BDD (Behavior Driven Development)</a>
to make sure the
software does what it's supposed to do.

  Dave is an excellent individual and team worker.&nbsp;
  He was easily able to decipher out work requests
  and worked on them diligently until they were completed,
  which was always done faster than we expected.
  </p>

  <p>
  Additionally, Dave is very personable and was easy to
  integrate with our team.&nbsp; He even offered helpful advice and direction to
  developers where appropriate.
  </p>

  <p>
  We were sad to lose Dave to another position and would work
  with him again in a heartbeat.
