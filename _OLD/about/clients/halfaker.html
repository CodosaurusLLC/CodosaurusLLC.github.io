<h3>Who are they?</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://halfaker.com" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  Halfaker & Associates</a>,
based in Arlington, Virginia, USA,
is a service-disabled veteran-owned, woman-owned, 8(a),
small federal government contractor,
serving the military, Homeland Defense, Veteran Affairs,
and Health &amp; Human Services.
</p>

<h3>What did I do, when, where?</h3>

<p>
I worked them from April to July 2012, about 99% remotely, as a temporary
employee, on a project for the Department of Veteran Affairs, to maintain the
VetGovPartner web site (no longer active).&nbsp;
(I was originally supposed to be a subcontractor, but at the last
minute it was revealed that the terms of <i>their</i> contract from VA,
dictated that all subcontracting companies had to be veteran-owned.)&nbsp; The
site is defunct as of now, but was for business networking and session
scheduling, before and at the VA's annual National Veteran Small Business
Conference.&nbsp;
(It was very well received there.)&nbsp;
I added assorted features, such as:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    Requiring that users claiming to be government personnel must fill in
    supervisor information (with a different email, both .gov)
  </li>

  <li>
    Having the system send that supervisor an email requesting
    confirmation
  </li>

  <li>
    Day-by-day agenda view (both overall and what the user had chosen to
    attend)
  </li>

  <li>
    Ability to find more sessions like a given one
  </li>

  <li>
    Detecting attendance or room-booking conflicts
  </li>

  <li>
    Assorted reports generated and emailed in assorted formats (HTML, PDF,
    CSV) in the background
  </li>

  <li>
    Adding assorted fields and ability to filter on them
  </li>

  <li>
    Profile completeness checks for users and organizations
  </li>

  <li>
    Resource availability checking
  </li>

</ul>

</p>I also added occasional bits of UI polish, but that's not my forte.
