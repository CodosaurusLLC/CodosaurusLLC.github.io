<h3>Who are they?</h3>

<p>
This institution, based in London, England,
claims to be Europe's leading issuer of credit cards.&nbsp;
It is the credit card department of a
very large and well known British bank.&nbsp;
Their lawyers have since told me that
they now prohibit any third party from using their logo
or stating that they are (or, presumably, have been) a client.&nbsp;
So be it.&nbsp;
You can probably figure it out if you really care.
</p>

<h3>What did I do, when, where?</h3>

<p>
I worked on a contract for them from October 2012 to March 2013,
about 70% remotely, as a temporary employee of
<a href="http://osgcorp.com" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  Object Systems Group</a>.&nbsp;
OSG had a team helping Analog Analytics,
which the client had recently acquired,
adapt desktop Rails views to mobile clients,
to create the client's new Bespoke Offers service (now defunct).&nbsp;
This was (I am told) one of the UK's first daily-deals web sites,
even though the USA's daily-deals web site market
was already pretty well saturated.&nbsp;
There were occasional trips to Portland, Oregon, USA, where AA is based,
and Irving, Texas, USA, where OSG is based,
plus a few brief meetings with OSG employees
and fellow contractors who happened to be local to me.&nbsp;
I also helped form the strategy for having mobile views
in the same <i>web</i> app
(OSG also made a dedicated <i>mobile</i> app),
created a way to detect that the web users were on a mobile client
in the first place,
helped the business analysts develop and triage use-cases,
split up long forms that would be clumsy on a mobile client,
and created a tool to help us know when
the mobile views might be out of sync with their desktop counterparts.
