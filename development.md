I mostly write
[back-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
software,
command-line programs,
and other such things,
in Ruby, Elixir, Python, and C,
with maybe bits of assorted other languages mixed in,
such as the nearly-inescapable JavaScript.&nbsp;
(I can do basic front-end work,
but it is not my forte.&nbsp;
I have also worked in
many other languages,
some of which I _don't_ want to work in again,
so I won't mention them here.)

There are three general ways I'll write software for you:

### 1: Fixed Price Projects

I may make a fixed-price bid on your project,
_if_ you've had it [roadmapped](roadmapping).&nbsp;
(Ideally by me;
I'm open to going by other people's roadmaps,
but will need to read the roadmap before I bid.)&nbsp;
Project-based work is done remotely
(barring any meetings we agree on before starting),
on the schedule we agree on
for completion and any other milestones.

### 2: Buying My Time

<!--
- You _must_ already have good
software engineering
processes and tooling
set up.&nbsp;
(If you don't, perhaps you need
[my advice service](advice)
first!)
-->

- I prefer to work on a B2B basis,
and will also do 1099, but not W2.

- I prefer a staff-augmentation role,
but am willing to do solo work.

- Light travel (up to about 20%) is okay,
<!--
meaning up to one trip per month,
lasting up to one week,
including the travel time,
which is billable.&nbsp;
You pay all expenses.
-->
but the time and expenses are fully billable.

- I generally don't do 40 hour weeks,
strongly prefer about 5-10,
and will do more than 20
only for unforeseeable emergencies.&nbsp;
Retainers are available for
10 to 80 hours per _month_.

- My usual hourly asking rate
is $199/hour.&nbsp;
However, this gets adjusted up or down,
by up to about 25%,
according to various factors of
pain (such as working in C, or bureaucracy) or
fun/convenience (such as working in Elixir, or on retainer).&nbsp;
There is also a discount for
agencies or other such middlemen,
to allow them room to make a profit.

### 3: As Part of my [Advice](advice) Service

This would be done as part of
[my "advising your team" service offering](advice),
so go see that page.&nbsp;
It's much more expensive,
and the goal is
not so much to contribute towards the software being finished,
but rather to observe the problems your team is having,
"lead by example",
and make recommendations
about processes, tools, techniques, etc.&nbsp;
So, if you just want me to write software for you,
I wouldn't advise this way...
but it's here for completeness.


### Other Notes

- I will fix for _free_
anything that we both agree is a bug
in software I wrote.

- I will _learn_ for free
anything that I think I will likely use
on later contracts for other clients.

- I often [speak](speaking) at conferences,
so there will be weeks when I will not be available,
sometimes multiple in a row.&nbsp;
However, I will inform you well in advance,
and retainers will be adjusted accordingly.&nbsp;

- **I am _not_ open to
relocation,
"permanent" employment,
"cleared" work (any more),
front-end-heavy work,
junior-level work,
system/network admin work,
spending months on the road,
changing careers out of IT,
or
working on-spec or mainly for equity!**&nbsp;
Please do not contact me about such things;
I will treat it as spam<!--,
which may include publicly ridiculing you and your company-->.

If there's anything else you need,
or you're ready to submit your inquiry,
go ahead and
[contact me](contact).
