I mostly write
[back-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
software,
command-line programs,
and other such things.&nbsp;
I can do basic front-end work,
but it is not my forte;
in particular, do not expect it to look pretty.&nbsp;
So, if your project is front-end, I'm out;
if it's full-stack, I might not be the best choice
(unless it's rather back-end heavy);
but if it's "back-end-ish",
I'm your <del>dinosaur</del> man!

As for specific technologies,
most of my work
since 2011
has been in Ruby,
including on Rails and off,
under macOS and Linux.&nbsp;
Lately I've been learning Elixir,
and would like to get some experience in that.&nbsp;
Before 2011, I did
tons of C
and SQL,
plus a decent bit of Python.&nbsp;
I have also worked in
many languages and OSes
that I _don't_ want to work in again,
so I won't mention them here
lest they attract the wrong recruiters.

There are three general ways I'll write software for you:

### 1: Fixed Price Projects

I may make a fixed-price bid on your project,
_if_ you've had it thoroughly
[roadmapped](roadmapping).&nbsp;
(Ideally by me;
I'm open to going by other people's roadmaps,
but will need to read the roadmap before I bid.)&nbsp;
Project-based work is done remotely
(barring any meetings we agree on before starting),
on the schedule we agree on
for completion and any other milestones.

### 2: Buying My Time

- You _must_ already have good
software engineering
processes and tooling
set up.&nbsp;
(If you don't, perhaps you need
[my advice service](advice)
first!)

- I don't do 40-hour weeks.&nbsp;
Instead, we will agree on
an attempted average,
usually of about 20 or less.&nbsp;
I will do more only in unforeseeable
emergencies.&nbsp;

- My usual "asking" rate per hour is
$140 for Elixir or Python,
$180 for Ruby,
and $240 for C.&nbsp;
This may get adjusted up or down
according to various factors of pain or fun.&nbsp;
There are discounts for paying by the day or week,
once we agree on a rough level of effort,
and for fast payment.&nbsp;
(Usual terms are net-30.)

- I prefer to work on a B2B basis,
and will also do 1099, but not W2.

- Light travel is okay,
meaning up to one trip per month,
lasting up to one week,
including the travel time,
which is billable.&nbsp;
You pay all expenses.

- Travel time for _ongoing local_ onsite work
(within about 15 miles of
[City of Fairfax, Virginia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fairfax,+VA){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"})
is free for the first hour per week,
per twenty hours of weekly work,
and fully billable after that.

- We _will_ use a contract,
and it _will_ include late-fees.


### 3: As Part of my [Advice](advice) Service

This would be done as part of
[my "advising your team" service offering](advice),
so go see that page.&nbsp;
It's much more expensive,
and the goal is
not so much to contribute towards the software being finished,
but rather to observe the problems your team is having,
"lead by example",
and make recommendations
about processes, tools, techniques, etc.&nbsp;
So, if you just want me to write software for you,
I wouldn't advise this way...
but it's here for completeness.


### Other Notes

- I will fix for _free_
anything that we both agree is a bug
in software I wrote.

- I will _learn_ for free
anything that I think I will likely use
on later contracts for other clients.

- I often [speak](speaking) at conferences,
so there will be weeks when I will not be available,
sometimes multiple in a row.&nbsp;
However, I will inform you well in advance.

- **I am _not_ open to
relocation,
"permanent" employment,
"cleared" work (any more),
front-end-heavy work,
junior-level work,
system/network admin work,
spending months on the road,
changing careers,
or
working for equity or "on spec"**!&nbsp;
Please do not contact me about such things;
I will treat it as spam,
which may include publicly ridiculing you and your company.

If there's anything else you need,
or you're ready to submit your inquiry,
go ahead and
[contact me](contact).
