I mostly write
[back-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
software,
command-line programs,
and other such things.&nbsp;
I can do basic front-end work,
but it is not my forte;
in particular, do not expect it to look pretty.&nbsp;
So, if your project is front-end, I'm out;
if it's full-stack, I might not be the best choice
(unless it's rather back-end heavy);
but if it's "back-end-ish",
I'm your <del>dinosaur</del> man!

As for specific technologies,
most of my work
since 2011
has been in Ruby,
including on Rails and off,
under macOS and Linux.&nbsp;
Lately I've been learning Elixir,
and would like to get some experience in that.&nbsp;
Before 2011, I did
tons of C
and SQL,
some Python,
and the nearly-inescapable JavaScript,
sometimes under
[Stratus VOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratus_VOS){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
or
[STOP](https://www.baesystems.com/en/product/stop-os){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
or other 
[Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}-workalikes,
plus many languages and OSes I _don't_ want to work in again.

There are three general ways I'll write software for you:

### 1: Fixed Price Projects

I may make a fixed-price bid on your project,
_if_ you've had it thoroughly
[roadmapped](roadmapping).&nbsp;
(Ideally by me;
I'm open to going by other people's roadmaps,
but will need to read the roadmap before I bid.)&nbsp;
Project-based work is done remotely
(barring any meetings we agree on before starting),
on the schedule we agree on
for completion and any other milestones.

### 2: Buying My Time

Since I'm semi-retired,
I feel entitled to be a bit picky, in the following ways:

- You _must_ already have good
software engineering
processes and tooling
set up.&nbsp;
(If you don't, perhaps you need
[my advice service](advice)
first, and time to act on it!)

- The project _should_
either use
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
or otherwise really "tickle my fancy".

- I don't do 40-hour weeks;
I _much_ prefer about 20 or fewer,
and billing by the day or larger unit.

- I also prefer fairly brief engagements,
of six months or less.

If you insist on counting hours,
it's $199 per hour or part thereof,
and more if you want me to
exceed that time
or track time more tightly than that.&nbsp;
However, there are discounts for larger units,
after we agree on a rough average level of effort.&nbsp;
You should not have to worry about
how many hours something takes me,
so long as I deliver on schedule and budget.&nbsp;
As
[Jonathan Stark](https://jonathanstark.com/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
says,
[Hourly Billing Is Nuts](https://jonathanstark.com/hbin){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}!

For the duration of the COVID pandemic,
this is remote-only,
though occasional travel
of up to a week
is OK.

<!--
Onsite work costs _much_ more.&nbsp;
_Ongoing_ onsite work
will _only_ be done within about 15 miles of
[City of Fairfax, Virginia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fairfax,+VA){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
and only after the COVID pandemic is fully over.
-->

### 3: As Part of my [Advice](advice) Service

This would be done as part of
[my "advising your team" service offering](advice),
so go see that page.&nbsp;
It's much more expensive,
and the goal is
not so much to contribute towards the software being finished,
but rather to observe the problems your team is having,
"lead by example",
and make recommendations
about processes, tools, techniques, etc.&nbsp;
So, if you just want me to write software for you,
I wouldn't advise this way...
but it's here for completeness.


### Other Notes

- I will fix for _free_
anything that we both agree is a bug
in software I wrote.

- I will _learn_ for free
anything that I think I will likely use
on later contracts for other clients.

- I have a TS, which could be useful for occasional site visits.&nbsp;
(If you don't know what I mean, don't worry, you don't need it.)

- I occasionally [speak](speaking) at conferences,
so there will be occasional weeks when I will not be available,
sometimes multiple in a row.&nbsp;
However, I will inform you well in advance.

- **I am _not_ open to
relocation,
"permanent" employment,
spending months on the road,
changing careers,
or
working for equity or "on spec"**!&nbsp;
Please do not contact me about such things;
I will treat it as spam.

If there's anything else you need,
or you're ready to submit your inquiry,
go ahead and
[contact me](contact).
