I will help you figure out
how to get where you want to go,
and how to get there,
to reduce the implementation risk.&nbsp;
Even if you outsource the implementation,
you get documents you can use to
"shop around" for a vendor,
and some guidance to help them do it.&nbsp;
(I may bid on that myself, or not.)

Mainly, we will discuss it, covering what it is you're trying to do,
breaking it down into manageable chunks,
and identify what is more or less urgent and/or difficult,
what depends on what, etc.

It comes in three basic sizes,
as follows:

- Hour:&nbsp;
  We (you and I) discuss it alone,
  remotely,
  for one hour,
  and you get no report.&nbsp;
  This costs $498.

- Day:&nbsp;
  Mainly, we discuss it
  over the course of a work-day,
  in several stretches,
  and within a week,
  you get a fairly _brief_ roadmap.&nbsp;
  In this case "we" means
  myself plus you,
  _or_ another person you designate
  (who may be different per stretch),
  or both.&nbsp;
  This costs $3,998,
  plus travel expenses,
  and travel time counts.

- Week:&nbsp;
  As above,
  each work-day of a work-week,
  except that you may have me talk to
  _two_ other people at a time without you.&nbsp;
  Within two weeks, you get a _more detailed_ roadmap.&nbsp;
  This costs $18,998,
  plus travel expenses,
  and travel time counts.

Each of these can be had in multiples,
with a discount
_if_ arranged in advance.

If you decide to do the development in-house,
you may want to take advantage of my
[advice](advice) or [training](training) services for your developers,
or discuss other ideas for further such services.

or you're ready to submit your inquiry,
