I will help you figure out
how to get where you want to go,
and how to get there,
to reduce the implementation risk.&nbsp;
Even if you outsource the implementation,
you get documents you can use to
"shop around" for a vendor,
and some guidance to help them do it.&nbsp;
(I may bid on that myself, or not.)

Mainly, we will discuss it, covering what it is you're trying to do,
breaking it down into manageable chunks,
and identify what is more or less urgent and/or difficult,
what depends on what, etc.

It comes in three basic sizes,
as follows:

- Hour:&nbsp;
  We discuss it alone,
  remotely,
  for one hour,
  and you get no report.&nbsp;
  This costs $399 for the first hour,
  and $299 for each further hour.

- Day:&nbsp;
  Mainly, we discuss it
  over the course of a work-day,
  in several stretches.&nbsp;
  In this case "we" means
  myself plus you,
  _or_ another person you designate
  (who may be different per stretch),
  or both.&nbsp;
  Within a week, you get a fairly _brief_ roadmap.&nbsp;
  This costs $3,999 for the first day,
  and $2,999 for each further day.&nbsp;
  (For the duration of the COVID pandemic, this is remote-only.&nbsp;
  When COVID is no more,
  I could come to your office,
  but you'd also have to pay my travel expenses,
  and all travel-related time would count towards the time spent.)

- Week:&nbsp;
  As above,
  each work-day of a work-week,
  except that you may have me talk to
  _two_ other people at a time without you.&nbsp;
  Within two weeks, you get a _more detailed_ roadmap.&nbsp;
  This costs $18,999 for the first week,
  and $14,999 for each further week.

If you decide to do the development in-house,
you may want to take advantage of my
[advice](advice) or [training](training) services for your developers,
or discuss other ideas for further such services.
