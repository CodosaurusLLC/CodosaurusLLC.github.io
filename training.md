I offer training classes,
but rather than languages, frameworks, and other common things,
I mainly teach
technology-agnostic
ways to produce high-quality software,
using
[the <span class="acrumen">ACRUMEN</span> Software Quality Definition](acrumen).&nbsp;
I can also teach on
"modern"
technology-agnostic
software engineering techniques
conducive to quality,
such as
[TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}/[BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
[Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
[Mob/Ensemble Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
[Mutation Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
and
[Property Based Testing](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-make-your-code-bulletproof-property-testing){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}.

These are each available in half-day length,
either via the Web or
at premises you arrange
(which must have proper presentation facilities).&nbsp;
Pricing is $199 per seat,
or a flate rate of $3,499
for ten to twenty students in-person,
or a flate rate of $1,499
for five to ten students remotely.&nbsp;
<!--
Discounts are available if you want
multiple classes on the same day,
full-day classes
(which you'll have to give me time to create),
or multiple consecutive full days.
-->

<!--
In-person classes _must_ be booked for
at least as long as
the required travel
(round-trip, door to door).&nbsp;
At least in this case,
you have many options how to put that together.&nbsp;
;-)
