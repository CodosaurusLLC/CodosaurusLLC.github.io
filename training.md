I offer training classes,
but rather than languages, frameworks, and
other such common things,
I mainly teach
technology-agnostic
ways to produce high-quality software,
using
[the <span class="acrumen">ACRUMEN</span> Software Quality Definition](acrumen).&nbsp;
I can also teach on
"modern"
technology-agnostic
software engineering techniques
conducive to quality,
such as:

- [Beginning Unit Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
- [TDD (Test Driven Development)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
- [BDD (Behavior Driven Development)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
- [Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
- [Mob/Ensemble Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
- [Mutation Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
- [Property Based Testing](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-make-your-code-bulletproof-property-testing){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
- [Doctests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctest){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}

and also
[Genetic Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}.

These are each available in
Ruby, Elixir, Python, JavaScript, and C,
except that
the Doctests class is only in Elixir and Python
(since the other languages don't have such a thing).&nbsp;
For an extra fee,
paid in advance,
I am willing to
work up these classes
in other programming languages.

Pricing is
$98 per seat _remotely_,
for five to ten students,
or $198 per seat _in person_,
for ten to twenty students,
plus travel expenses.&nbsp;
(More students may be added,
but the price goes up for each one.&nbsp;
Smaller classes may be held,
but they will be priced at the minimum.&nbsp;
There are no refunds for no-shows.)

Classes are half a day long,
and conducted in English,
either via the Web or
at premises _you_ arrange
(which must have proper presentation facilities).&nbsp;
For an extra fee, paid in advance,
I am willing to _attempt_
conducting classes
in French or Portuguese,
at _half_ the usual minimum and maximum.

<!--
Discounts are available if you want
multiple classes on the same day,
full-day classes
(which you'll have to give me time to create),
or multiple consecutive full days.
-->

Once [Exercism](https://exercism.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
relaunches their Teams version,
I _may_ have a training offering
whereby I will
lead your junior developers through the
[Exercism](https://exercism.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
track of any language I know.&nbsp;
Inquire for terms and pricing, after the relaunch.

If there's anything else you need,
or you're ready to submit your inquiry,
go ahead and
[contact me](contact).
