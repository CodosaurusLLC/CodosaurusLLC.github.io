Do you have:

- software projects you're not sure how to proceed on,
- developers who produce low-quality software,
- inefficient development processes,
- questions on how your code could be improved, or
- a need for some extra help to Get Stuff Done?

If so, then
[**let The Codosaurus help!**](/contact)&nbsp;
I provide the following services:

- [**Roadmapping your projects**](/services/roadmaps){:class="big"}
  to figure out
  how to get
  where you want to go,
  and some shortcuts and speedbumps.

- [**Advising your development teams**](/services/advice){:class="big"}
  on tools, techniques, processes, etc.
  to help them work <i>efficiently</i>.

- [**Training your developers**](/services/training){:class="big"}
  how to write better software faster,
  saving money on
  rework, fixing, and support.

- [**Reviewing your (Ruby) code**](/services/code_review){:class="big"}
  to help make it more
  understandable,
  maintainable,
  efficient,
  idiomatic,
  etc.

- [**Writing software**](/services/development){:class="big"}
  for a fixed price after [roadmapping](/services/roadmaps),
  as staff-aug as part of [team advice](/services/advice),
  or just to help you get it done.
