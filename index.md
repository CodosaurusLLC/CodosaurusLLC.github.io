# I help companies write better software faster.

(Mainly established American
[SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
 companies,
 but also occasional others.&nbsp;

<div class="card">
<h2>COVID-19 UPDATE</h2>
For the duration of the pandemic,
I am only offering <i>remote</i> services.
</div>

<br/>

<div class="card">
<h2>SEMI-RETIREMENT UPDATE</h2>
<p>As of early November 2020,
I am "semi-retired".&nbsp;
So, for the foreseeable future,
I am no longer offering
staff-augmentation software development services,
nor
full-week
advice sessions.&nbsp;
Instead, you can have multiple
all-<i>day</i> sessions --
and those are now shorter.</p>

<p>Also, once the COVID pandemic is over,
it is unlikely
that I will return
to offering
on-site services --
unless I really want to visit your location!&nbsp;
;-)</p>

Do you have:

- Software projects you're not sure how to proceed on?
- Developers who produce low-quality software?
- Inefficient development processes?
- A conference or podcast, in need of speakers or guests?

<!--
- Code where you're not sure of its quality?
- A need for a few extra hands to get Get Shhhhtuff Done?
-->

If so, then
[**let The Codosaurus help!**](/contact)&nbsp;
I provide the following services:

- [**Roadmapping your projects**](/services/roadmaps){:class="big"}
  to figure out
  how to get
  where you want to go,
  and some shortcuts and speedbumps.

- [**Advising your development teams**](/services/advice){:class="big"}
  on tools, techniques, processes, etc.
  to help them work <i>efficiently</i>.

- [**Training your developers**](/services/training){:class="big"}
  how to write _better software faster_,
  saving money on
  rework, fixing, and support.

<!--
- [**Reviewing your (Ruby) code**](/services/code_review){:class="big"}
  to help make it more
  understandable,
  maintainable,
  efficient,
  idiomatic,
  etc.

- [**Writing software**](/services/development){:class="big"}
  for a fixed price after [roadmapping](/services/roadmaps),
  as staff-aug as part of [team advice](/services/advice),
  or just to help you get it done.
-->

- And I [**speak**](/speaking){:class="big"} at conferences and on podcasts.
