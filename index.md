# The Codosaurus is now ***retired***... <br> more or less.

I will still
[speak](speaking)
at your in-person conference,
or on your podcast,
for a sliding scale
from "free for free conferences where I would be anyway"
to "full expenses (maybe more) for big for-profit conferences".

If you want me to
[speak](speaking) at your _corporate_ event,
or
[do other software development related consulting](services),
<!--
[sling code for you](development);
[mentor your devs](development);
[advise about processes, tools, techniques, etc.](advice);
[train developers](training)
how to write better software faster
(including what "better" even means in the first place);
or maybe even
[roadmap your projects or large features](roadmapping),
-->
it will be a tough sell but
you have two choices.&nbsp;
Either convince me that
it will be fun enough and/or for a good enough cause
that I should do it for _free_,
or pay well enough that it's worth coming out of retirement.<!--&nbsp;
($10,000 _minimum_,
mid-$1xx/hour _minimum_ for any hourly work,
and 20 hours/week _maximum_.)-->

<!--
I do these mainly for
established
American
[SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
companies,
but other companies could be a reasonable fit too.&nbsp;
See
[the Clients page](clients) for more details.
-->

The other big news that will affect potential clients,
is that I will soon be moving to Portugal!&nbsp;
This is currently slated for late July 2026.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, it also means that
international travel will be severely limited
in August, probably September, and possibly October.

I know it's not very pretty now, but at least you get the general idea!)
