### I help companies write better software faster.

I do this by:

- **[Roadmapping projects and large features](roadmapping)**
to help you figure out where you want to go, and how to get there.

- **[Advising development teams](advice)**
about processes, tools, techniques, etc.

- **[Training developers](training)**
how to write better software faster,
including what "better" even means in the first place.

- **[Speaking](speaking)**
at corporate events, conferences, and podcasts.

- **[Writing software](development)**,
including mentoring juniors,
all done at least mostly remotely, and very part-time.

I do these mainly for
established
American
[SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
companies,
but other companies could be a reasonable fit too.&nbsp;
See
[the Clients page](clients) for more details.

I know it's not very pretty now, but at least you get the general idea!)
