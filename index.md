<h2>COVID-19 AND SEMI-RETIREMENT UPDATE</h2>
<p>
For the duration of the pandemic,
I am only offering <i>remote</i> services.&nbsp;
Also, I am now semi-retired,
so,
staff-aug work
will be
almost entirely
limited to:
<ul>
<li>roughly six months or less in length</li>
<li>roughly twenty hours a week or less in "width"</li>
<li>projects that either use Elixir or otherwise really tickle my fancy.&nbsp; ;-)</li>
</ul>
</p>

Do you have:

- Software projects you're not sure how to proceed on?
- Developers who produce low-quality software?
- Inefficient development processes?
- A conference or podcast, in need of speakers or guests?
- A need for a couple extra hands to get Get Shhhhtuff Done?

<!--
 - Code where you're not sure of its quality?
-->

If so, then
[**let The Codosaurus help!**](/contact)&nbsp;
I provide the following services:

- [**Roadmapping your projects**](/services/roadmaps){:class="big"}
  to figure out
  how to get
  where you want to go,
  and some shortcuts and speedbumps.

- [**Advising your development teams**](/services/advice){:class="big"}
  on tools, techniques, processes, etc.
  to help them work <i>efficiently</i>.

- [**Training your developers**](/services/training){:class="big"}
  how to write _better software faster_,
  saving money on
  rework, fixing, and support.

<!--
- [**Reviewing your (Ruby) code**](/services/code_review){:class="big"}
  to help make it more
  understandable,
  maintainable,
  efficient,
  idiomatic,
  etc.
-->

- [**Writing software**](/services/development){:class="big"}
  for a fixed price after [roadmapping](/services/roadmaps),
  as staff-aug as part of [team advice](/services/advice),
  or just to help you get it done.

- And I [**speak**](/speaking){:class="big"} at conferences and on podcasts.
