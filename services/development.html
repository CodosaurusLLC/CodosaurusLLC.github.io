<h2>The Basics</h2>

<p>I mostly write
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends")
   rel="nofollow"
   target="_new">back-end"</a>
software,
command-line programs,
and other such things,
where the emphasis is on correctness, robustness, efficiency, etc.
rather than visual design.&nbsp;
I can do basic front-end work,
but it is not at all my forte;
do not expect it to look pretty.&nbsp;
So, if your project is "front-end", I'm out;
if it's "full-stack", I might not be the best choice;
but if it's "back-end", I'm your <del>dinosaur</del> man!</p>

<p>As for specific technologies,
most of my work <i>lately</i>
has been in Ruby,
including on Rails, in Sinatra, and non-web.&nbsp;
Of course, that includes some JavaScript.&nbsp;
In the past I've done
tons of C and SQL,
some Python,
and many other languages.&nbsp;
I'm now learning Elixir (and Phoenix)
and would like to get some experience in those.&nbsp;
For the right opportunity,
I'll learn almost anything.&nbsp;
But I don't do Windows.&nbsp;
See
<a href="/about/skills">the Skills page</a>
for more details.</p>


<h2>Fixed Price Projects</h2>

<p>I may make a fixed-price bid on your project,
but <i>only if you have used
  <a href="/services/roadmaps">my roadmapping services</a>
  for it first</i>.&nbsp;
  Project-based work is done remotely
  (barring any meetings we agree on before starting),
  on the schedule we agree on
  for completion and any other milestones.</p>

<p>I generally require a 50% deposit up front,
and the rest net-20.&nbsp;
For long projects,
we may negotiate other milestone payments.</p>


<h2>Buying My Time</h2>

<p>
I prefer not to do <i>hours</i>,
let alone partial ones,
rather full <i>weeks</i> or <i>half-months</i>, or at least days.&nbsp;
This saves <i>both</i> of us overhead and conflict.&nbsp;
You should not have to worry about
how many hours something takes me,
so long as I deliver on schedule and budget.&nbsp;
As <a href="https://jonathanstark.com/"
  rel="nofollow" target="_new">Jonathan Stark</a>
says,
<a href="https://jonathanstark.com/hbin"
  rel="nofollow" target="_new">Hourly Billing Is Nuts</a>!
</p>

<p>
Rates depend on a variety of factors.&nbsp;
If we agree on some arrangement other than hourly,
we also agree on a Level of Effort,
usually phrased in terms of a fractional
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">FTE</a>,
and I work up a rate.&nbsp;
Either way, my rate usually works out in the mid-$1xx range per hour.&nbsp;
Then, assorted factors can either raise or lower it,
and I'll negotiate a <i>little</i> bit.&nbsp;
Inquire for details.

See
<a href="rate_estimator">my rate estimator</a>
for details.
-->
</p>

<p>I generally bill
every two weeks,
net-20,
with a deposit of
one invoice's worth
(applied to your final invoice).&nbsp;
All <i>unusual</i> overhead time counts,
including any reports you require,
travel, and related time,
but not <i>normal</i> things like creating and sending your invoice.
</p>

<!--

  <p>When working time-based,
  I mainly do
  remote
  part-time
  B2B or 1099
  contracts,
  in a staff-augmentation capacity,
  for one week to six months at a time.&nbsp;
  I will also <i>consider:</i></p>
  <ul class="checklist">
  <li>a <i>short</i> "commute"
  (up to about
  15 miles
  from
  <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fairfax,+VA"
     rel="nofollow"
     target="_new">
    Fairfax City, Virginia
  </a>);</li>
  <li><i>light</i> travel
  (up to two weeks at a time,
  up to 20% of the time);</li>
  <li><i>temporary</i> (up to three months) W2 employment,</li>
  <li><i>longer</i> contracts (including renewals),</li>
  <li>and <i>solo</i> work.</li>
  </ul>

-->

<p><i>You must already have good
software engineering
processes and tooling
set up</i>.&nbsp;
(If you don't, perhaps you need
<a href="/services/advice">my advice service</a>
first, and time to act on it!)</p>


<h2>Other Notes</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    I will <i>fix</i> for free
    anything that we both agree is a bug
    in software I wrote.&nbsp;
    (This will usually require
    that there be
    requirements,
    or at least
    approved tickets
    or
    approved tests.&nbsp;
    There is a deadline of
    one month after your acceptance
    or two months after my submission,
    whichever comes first.)
  </li>

  <li>
    I will <i>learn</i> for free
    anything that I think I will likely use
    on later contracts for other clients.
  </li>

  <li>
    I work <i>remotely</i>,
    so if you want me on-site,
    that travel time counts too.
  </li>

  <li>
    I have a TS (though <i>not</i> the various add-ons).&nbsp;
    If you don't know what I mean,
    I won't tell you, but you don't need it.&nbsp;
    (Yes it's somewhat odd to mention in combo with working remotely,
    but it can be beneficial for on-site <i>visits</i>.)
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>I am <i>not</i> open to
      "permanent" employment,
      changing careers,
      relocation,
      spending months on the road,
      or
      working for equity</b>.&nbsp;
    Please do not contact me about such things;
    I will treat it as spam.
  </li>

</ul>
