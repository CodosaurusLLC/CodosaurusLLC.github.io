<h2>The Basics</h2>

<p>I mostly write
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends")
   rel="nofollow"
   target="_new">"back-end"</a>
software,
command-line programs,
and other such things,
where the emphasis is on correctness, robustness, efficiency, etc.
rather than visual design.&nbsp;
I can do basic front-end work,
but it is not at all my forte;
in particular, do not expect it to look pretty.&nbsp;
So, if your project is "front-end", I'm out;
if it's "full-stack", I might not be the best choice
(unless it's rather back-end heavy);
but if it's "back-end", I'm your <del>dinosaur</del> man!</p>

<p>As for specific technologies,
most of my work <i>lately</i>
has been in Ruby,
including on Rails, in Sinatra, and non-web.&nbsp;
I'm now learning Elixir (and Phoenix)
and would like to get some experience in those.&nbsp;
In the past I've done
tons of C and SQL,
some Python,
and many other languages.&nbsp;
For the right opportunity,
I'll learn almost anything.&nbsp;
But I don't do Windows.&nbsp;
See
<a href="/about/skills">the Skills page</a>
for more details.</p>


<h2>Fixed Price Projects</h2>

<p>I may make a fixed-price bid on your project,
but <i>only if you have used
  <a href="/services/roadmaps">my roadmapping services</a>
  for it first</i>.&nbsp;
  Project-based work is done remotely
  (barring any meetings we agree on before starting),
  on the schedule we agree on
  for completion and any other milestones.</p>

<p>I generally require a 50% deposit up front,
and the rest net-20.&nbsp;
For long projects,
we may negotiate other milestone payments.</p>


<h2>Buying My Time</h2>

<p>
If you just want me to join your team and program, okay,
but I won't be doing any of my <i>other</i> services for you
on a time basis.&nbsp;
I don't do <i>hours</i>,
let alone partial ones,
rather at least days, preferably fortnights.&nbsp;
This saves <i>both</i> of us overhead and conflict.&nbsp;
You should not have to worry about
how many hours something takes me,
so long as I deliver on schedule and budget.&nbsp;
As <a href="https://jonathanstark.com/"
  rel="nofollow" target="_new">Jonathan Stark</a>
says,
<a href="https://jonathanstark.com/hbin"
  rel="nofollow" target="_new">Hourly Billing Is Nuts</a>!
</p>

<p>
My rate for <i>remote</i> work,
for approximately the Level of Effort (LoE) of one
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">Full Time Employee/Equivalent</a> (FTE),
is as follows:
</p>

<table cellspacing="3">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Timespan</th><th class="numeric">Rate</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Day:</td>
      <td class="numeric">$1199</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Week:</td>
      <td class="numeric">$5,499</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fortnight:</td>
      <td class="numeric">$9,999</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Half-Month:</td>
      <td class="numeric">$10,999</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Month:</td>
      <td class="numeric">$21,999</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
Onsite work costs extra,
and will only be done (if on an ongoing basis) within about 20 miles of
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fairfax,+VA">Fairfax, Virginia</a>.&nbsp;
(Recruiters, <i>please</i> check the location before contacting me!)&nbsp;
All travel time counts, including to and from onsite work.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Also, we may be able to arrange a <i>partial</i>-FTE LoE.</p>

<p><i>You must already have good
software engineering
processes and tooling
set up</i>.&nbsp;
(If you don't, perhaps you need
<a href="/services/advice">my advice service</a>
first, and time to act on it!)</p>


<h2>Other Notes</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    I will <i>fix</i> for free
    anything that we both agree is a bug
    in software I wrote.&nbsp;
    (This will usually require
    that there be
    requirements,
    or at least
    approved tickets
    or
    approved tests.&nbsp;
    There is a deadline of
    one month after your acceptance
    or two months after my submission,
    whichever comes first.)
  </li>

  <li>
    I will <i>learn</i> for free
    anything that I think I will likely use
    on later contracts for other clients.
  </li>

  <li>
    I work <i>remotely</i>,
    so if you want me on-site,
    that travel time counts too.
  </li>

  <li>
    I have a TS (though <i>not</i> the various add-ons).&nbsp;
    If you don't know what I mean,
    I won't tell you, but you don't need it.&nbsp;
    (Yes it's somewhat odd to mention in combo with working remotely,
    but it can be beneficial for on-site <i>visits</i>.)
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>I am <i>not</i> open to
      "permanent" employment,
      changing careers,
      relocation,
      spending months on the road,
      or
      working for equity</b>.&nbsp;
    Please do not contact me about such things;
    I will treat it as spam.
  </li>

</ul>

If there's anything else you need,
or you're ready to submit your inquiry,
