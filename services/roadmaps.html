<h2>What Is It?</h2>

<p>
I will help you figure out
how to get where you want to go,
and how to get there.&nbsp;
That includes figuring out
where you want to go,
if you're not sure!&nbsp;
Even if you outsource the implementation,
you get a document you can use to
"shop around" for
a vendor,
and some guidance to help them do it.&nbsp;
(I may bid on that myself, or not.)
</p>

<h2>Why Do It?</h2>

<p>
Roadmapping
<i>reduces the risk</i>
of your project,
in several ways:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    As the name implies,
    it outlines the <i>way forward</i>.&nbsp;
    You don't have to wander around,
    with false starts and dead ends.
  </li>

  <li>
    It helps uncover <i>assumptions</i>
    you may have made,
    that might not be so obvious to an outsider,
    and may in fact be wrong.
  </li>

  <li>
    It helps nail down the <i>scope</i>.&nbsp;
    Both you and the implementor(s) can see
    exactly what is included or not,
    at each phase.
  </li>

  <li>
    That, and exposing other things such as
    starting needs or ongoing post-project needs,
    help nail down the <i>cost</i>.
  </li>

  <li>
    It also helps draw a clear <i>connection</i>
    between
    the <i>business outcome</i>
    that the project is supposed to provide you,
    and the <i>possible solutions</i>.&nbsp;
    This helps ensure that you're
    <i>solving the right problem</i>.
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

<h3>Part 1: Arranging</h3>

<p>
First, you
<a href="/contact">send me some generic information</a>.&nbsp;
I email you back, asking some more questions.&nbsp;
Some of these are generic,
and
some are follow-ups to what you said.&nbsp;
There may be some more back-and-forth.&nbsp;
This is all to make sure that
we make best use of
our limited time together.
</p>

<p>
If we determine
that my roadmapping services
are a good fit for you,
we determine how many days of
more in-depth discussion
we need.&nbsp;
This and the expenses
determine the total price.&nbsp;
After you send in a 50% deposit,
we set a date and a place
(which may be virtual).
</p>

<h3>Part 2: Discussions</h3>

<p>
When that date comes,
you and I,
and up to four additional people at a time
(maximum ten per day),
talk for as many days as we agreed on,
to discuss your
situation, wants, needs, capabilities, plans, concerns, etc.
in further depth.&nbsp;
We cover what it is you're trying to do,
breaking it down into manageable chunks,
and identify what is more or less
urgent,
difficult,
etc.
</p>

<p>
About halfway through,
we'll check our progress,
to see if
you feel that
we are on track to cover
everything you need.&nbsp;
If not,
we'll discuss options such as
covering a broader area but in less depth,
staying more focused,
changing direction,
taking more time now (if I'm available),
scheduling an additional session for later,
and so on.
</p>

<p>
At the end,
we'll check coverage again,
to see if we're really done discussing,
or if we need to
take more time now or
schedule additional sessions.&nbsp;
We may need that to
go into more depth,
examine new ideas,
discuss something we skipped,
or other reasons.
</p>

<h3>Part 3: Delivering</h3>

<p>
After our discussion,
I do some more research
to close up any gaps,
maybe ask you some more questions
by phone or email,
and finally send you a report,
containing an overview,
and for each feature
or other such requirement:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A title</li>
  <li>General narrative</li>
  <li>Any other features it depends on</li>
  <li>Triage by levels of effort, business value, and
    urgency, meaning whether it should be
    in your Minimum Viable Product ("MVP"),
    in another release
    after the MVP
    has validated
    the application's idea ("Later"),
    or
    put off indefinitely ("wish list")
  </li>
  <li>
    Any
    likely challenges
    (and their potential solutions),
    shortcuts,
    pitfalls,
    Best/Worst Practices,
    etc.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The rankings lets you do further calculations
and sort them however you want.&nbsp;
For instance, you can
divide the reward by the effort,
to "bang for the buck",
then sort them by that,
within each phase.
</p>

<p>
The narrative and level of effort
will let you stick them right into your
issue-tracker<super><a href="#need-advice">*</a></super>,
generally as Epics,
so your team can get right to work on
breaking them down into Stories...
or I can do that for an extra fee (see below).
</p>

<p>
After I send the report,
you then have
20 days
to send me the other half of the payment,
plus any expenses.
</p>

<h2>How Long Does It Take?</h2>

<p>
As implied above,
we need to discuss that.&nbsp;
My initial very rough estimate is
half a day of discussions
per man-year of effort
<i>you</i> estimate to be involved,
plus another half-day.&nbsp;
<!--
(If you don't have an estimate for that,
estimate 1/$200,000 of the budget.&nbsp;
If you don't have an estimate for <i>that</i>,
we'll need to talk in a lot more detail.)&nbsp;
-->
Then I will need about as long as we talked for,
to write up the report.&nbsp;
There may also be delays if I need to ask you more questions.
</p>

<h2>How Much Does It Cost?</h2>

<p>
The price is
$4,000 per day,
plus expenses.&nbsp;
There is no limit for remote work,
but I will spend a maximum of
two consecutive weeks,
and 20% of my time,
on travel.
</p>

<h2>What Else Can I Get?</h2>

<p>
After you've had a chance to review the report,
we can discuss whether you want some additional services,
for additional prices we will discuss.&nbsp;
Mainly:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    I can make recommendations about the
    technology stack,
    architecture,
    skills needed to implement it,
    timeline,
    etc.
    --
    in short, everything,
    taking into consideration
    any constraints you specify,
    such as a
    budget
    or
    current technology.
  </li>

  <li>
    I can break down each
    MVP or Later "epic"
    (or at least, specific ones you want)
    into User Stories.&nbsp;
    Usually I do these in
    <a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/advantages-of-the-as-a-user-i-want-user-story-template"
       rel="nofollow"
       target="_new">
      "As, Want, So" format</a>,
    and write at least one test case for each story,
    usually in
    <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/gwt"
       rel="nofollow"
       target="_new">
      "Given, When, Then" format'</a>.&nbsp;
    I can write just a "main happy path" test case
    (i.e., test that everything works under normal circumstances),
    or if you like, I can also write test cases for
    "alternate happy paths"
    (i.e., things that should still work but are a little unusual),
    and even reasonably likely "sad paths"
    (error cases,
    whether
    user error
    or
    "technical difficulties").
  </li>

  <li>
    You may ask me to provide some
    conceptual mockups,
    for particular features.&nbsp;
    Be warned, however, that
    <i>I am not a designer</i>.&nbsp;
    The results will be utilitarian,
    if not downright ugly.&nbsp;
    However, they will at least show
    how <i>I</i> envision the feature working,
    and can provide a starting point for <i>your</i>
    designers or front-end developers.
  </li>

  <li>
    I may, or may not, also provide a fixed-price bid
    to actually <i>implement</i> your idea.&nbsp;
    If I don't, you can try to talk me into it,
    but I have probably declined for good reasons,
    such as not having the time or all the skills needed,
    or perhaps I just don't think
    it's worth enough to <i>you</i>
    to be worth enough to <i>me</i>.&nbsp;
    That said, perhaps we can come to terms on a
    <i>partial</i>
    implementation,
    or working with your existing team in a "staff augmentation" style,
    possibly including some ongoing
    mentoring,
    <a href="/services/advice">process improvement</a>,
    and other value-added services.
  </li>

  <li>
    Of course I'm happy to "cross-sell" you on my
    <a href="/services/training">training</a>
    and
    <a href="/services/advice">team process/tools advice</a>
    services.&nbsp;
    :-)
  </li>

  <li>
    If there are other add-on services
    you would like,
    we can discuss them then.
  </li>

</ul>

<h2>What's With the Sizes?</h2>

<p>
Some people can get going with less detail.&nbsp;
Some need more.&nbsp;
By way of analogy, suppose your project is to drive from LA to NY.
<p>

<ul>

  <li>
    A "small" roadmap
    would tell you what highway to take
    from LA to what next highway,
    and so on until you hit NY,
    with the mileage and anticipated time
    for each leg of the trip,
    and any tolls.
    </li>

    <li>
    A "medium" roadmap
    would also offer a few alternate routes,
    and tell you about
    construction delays,
    particularly good or bad rest stops or attractions or other things
    to stop at or avoid,
    and try to break it up into
    days' worth of travel at good stopping points --
    not specifying hotels, but at least what city.
  </li>

  <li>
    A "large" roadmap
    would include
    <i>customized</i> advice on
    where to stop for rest, sleep, gas, food, entertainment, etc.,
    even if no particularly good or bad options present themselves,
    based on how far I believe you can go in one stretch or day
    (based on travel tolerance of all people going along, vehicle type, etc.),
    what sorts of things along the way I think might appeal to you, etc.&nbsp;
    We could even add on
    extra research (such as
    different vehicles, drivers, cities, or dates,
    multi-driver strategies,
    canceling the trip,
    and alternatives to driving at all
    such as flying or doing your business remotely),
    or extra services (such as
    making the reservations for you,
    signing you up for applicable loyalty discount cards,
    or even doing the driving myself).
  </li>

</ul>
