<h2>What Is It?</h2>

<p>This means that I
look at the code that your team
(whether in-house, outsourced, or whatever)
has written or changed,
and comment on it,
as if I were assigned to review it as a Pull Request and being very picky.&nbsp;
I will point out ways in which it
is very good,
and where it could be made more
understandable,
maintainable,
efficient,
Ruby-idiomatic,
etc.&nbsp;
(I offer this only in Ruby so far, including
Rails, Sinatra, non-web, and tests in RSpec, MiniTest, and Cucumber.)</p>

<h2>Why Do It?</h2>

<p>It's a quick, easy, cheap way to tell
whether your team is producing good code.&nbsp;
If they are, great, carry on!&nbsp;
If not, you might want to use some of my other services.</p>

<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

<ul>

  <li>
    You
    <a href="/contact">send me some generic information</a>
    to tell me you're interested in this service.
  </li>

  <li>I email you back, asking some more questions.</li>

  <li>You get me the code, and pay a 50% deposit.</li>

  <li>
    I verify the sizes, and
    if your estimate was low by a lot,
    you pay some more deposit.
  </li>

  <li>
    I write up a report and send it to you,
    usually within a week.
  </li>

  <li>
    You get
    one week
    to submit
    one round
    of asking me for clarifications on what I've written.&nbsp;
    If you have questions,
    I will usually respond within a week.
  </li>

  <li>You then have 20 days to pay the rest of the fee.</li>

</ul>

<h2>How Much Does It Cost?</h2>

<!--

<p>There are two styles: All Code, and Changes Only.</p>

<p>
The price for an "All Code" review is
10 cents per byte in your code files,
including any configuration, other data, etc.
that I need to look at to determine the actual operation.&nbsp;
So, for instance, if your code totals
1,234,567 bytes,
that's $123,456.70,
but if it's only
123,456 bytes,
that's only $12,345.60.&nbsp;
You can reduce your charge by only sending me
the parts you want me to review,
and anything else needed for context.&nbsp;
There is a minimum charge of $1,000,
enough for 10,000 bytes of code.
</p>

<p>
The price for an "Changes Only" review is
<i>one dollar</i> per byte
on each <i>changed, added, or deleted line</i>,
plus <i>1/10</i> of a cent per byte of any other <i>unchanged</i>
code, configs, data, etc. needed for context.&nbsp;
(You <i>must</i> send me
<i>complete</i> "before" and "after" versions
of the changed sections,
plus everything else needed for context.&nbsp;
However, you may omit anything you're confident I won't need.)&nbsp;
For instance, if your change has
123 bytes of added lines,
456 bytes of deleted lines,
and 789 bytes of otherwise changed lines,
and you send an additional 43,210 bytes of "context",
that's
$123 + $456 + $789 + $43.21 = $1,411.21.&nbsp;
This may <i>sound</i> expensive,
but it also lets me check additional items,
such as whether the new code does the same thing as the old,
and if so, whether the tests have been updated to match.
</p>

<p>In both cases, if the code, changes, etc.
are mostly
bulky but irrelevant data,
or you have some other reason why
your code would be unusually easy to review,
we can discuss discounts.</p>

-->

<p>
Frankly I'm not sure yet.&nbsp;
So far I'm thinking something around ten cents a byte.&nbsp;
(That's for what I have to actually <i>look</i> at,
whether to review or <i>for context</i>.)&nbsp;
<a href="/contact">Contact me</a>
and we'll discuss your situation --
but be aware there will be a minimum charge of $1,000.&nbsp;
</p>

<h2>What Else Can I Get?</h2>

<p>After you've had a chance to review the report,
we can discuss whether you want some additional services,
for additional prices we will discuss.&nbsp;
Mainly, I can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make whatever changes I recommended</li>
  <li>Update tests to confirm new behavior</li>
  <li>Make it conform to your chosen coding style</li>
  <li>Make a Rubocop configuration to describe your chosen style</li>
  <li>Teach your team about the value of choosing and adhering to a style</li>
  <li>Check the code again after your team has worked on it more</li>
</ul>

<p>If there are other add-on services you would like,
we can discuss them then.</p>

<p>
If there's anything else you need,
or you're ready to submit your inquiry,
go ahead and
