<h2 class="card">
  This page is
  in the process of
  being updated
  due to
  the COVID pandemic
  and
  my semi-retirement.
</h2>

<h2>What Is It?</h2>

<p>
This means working directly with
the <i>developers</i>,
their <i>leadership</i>,
their <i>management</i>
(not necessarily the same as leadership!),
and any other people they interact with as a developer
(such as designers, QA, support, etc.),
to determine the current and desired situations,
and what
tools, techniques, processes, etc.
would be most effective
to bridge that gap
(within a reasonable budget).
</p>

<h2>Why Do It?</h2>

<p>
Mainly, to help your team work <i>efficiently</i>,
rather than being hobbled by
an inefficient process,
bad tools,
etc.&nbsp;
Yes, it's a bad craftsman who blames his tools...
but a good craftsman will still do better with good tools
(and techniques, and processes).
</p>

<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

<h3>Part 1: Arranging</h3>

<p>
First, you
<a href="/contact">send me some generic information</a>.&nbsp;
I email you back, asking some more questions.&nbsp;
Some of these are generic,
and
some are follow-ups to what you said.&nbsp;
There may be some more back-and-forth.&nbsp;
This is all to make sure that
we make best use of
our limited time together.
</p>

<p>
If we determine
that my advice services
are a good fit for you,
we discuss to determine how many weeks of
observation and discussion you need.&nbsp;
This and the expenses
determine the total price.&nbsp;
After you send in a 50% deposit,
we set a date and a place
(which may be virtual).
</p>

<h3>Part 2: Discussing</h3>

<p>
When that date comes,
you and I,
and your development team,
and the other people I mentioned above,
discuss:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>what challenges your team is facing,</li>
  <li>what you'd <i>like</i> the situation to be,</li>
  <li>what unique <i>strengths</i> and <i>weaknesses</i> your team has,</li>
  <li>what sorts of things you're planning to have them work on,</li>
  <li>what you're doing now,</li>
  <li>what else you've tried,</li>
  <li>how that worked,</li>
  <li>what <i>budget</i> you have for personnel, tools, and infrastructure,</li>
</ul>

<p>
and so on.&nbsp;
I also <i>observe</i> your current
processes, meetings, tools, etc. <i>in action</i>,
especially any
planning and review meetings
(even relevant ones where
<i>the developers are not present</i>).
</p>

<p>
About halfway through,
we'll check our progress,
to see if
you feel that
we are on track to cover
everything you need.&nbsp;
If not,
we'll discuss options such as
covering a broader area but in less depth,
staying more focused,
changing direction,
taking more time now (if I'm available),
scheduling an additional weeks for later,
and so on.
</p>

<p>
At the end,
we'll check coverage again,
to see if we're really done discussing,
or if we need to
take more time now or
schedule additional sessions.&nbsp;
We may need that to
go into more depth,
examine new ideas,
discuss something we skipped,
or other reasons.
</p>

<p>
You may also have me temporarily <i>join</i> your team,
so as to experience the situation from within,
ideally including both on-site and remote work
if you offer both.&nbsp;
See <a href="/about/skills">the Skills page</a>
for my current technical skills.&nbsp;
However,
even without knowing
the specific technology stack,
I can observe a lot about
how your team works --
including how they "onboard" a new person,
which can be critical to success.
</p>

<h3>Part 3: Delivering</h3>

<p>
After our discussion,
I do some more research
to close up any gaps, and
maybe ask you some more questions
by phone or email.&nbsp;
Within about a week or two,
I will send you a report,
containing detailed recommendations
about processes, techniques, tools, etc.
tailored to your staff, projects, etc.&nbsp;
You then have
20 days
to send me the other half of the payment.
</p>

<h2>How Long Does It Take?</h2>

<p>
As implied above,
we need to discuss that.&nbsp;
My initial rough estimate is
one week of discussion and observation
per twenty
people to interview
or
hours of meetings to
observe and/or participate in.&nbsp;
(The rest of the time is for
such things as
writing and consolidating notes,
investigating your systems on my own,
etc.)&nbsp;
Then add any weeks that you like me to
work as <i>part</i> of your team.&nbsp;
Finally, I will need
about as long as the discussions,
to
finish my research
and write up your report.
</p>

<!--
<p>
For instance,
suppose you have
five developers,
four designers,
three testers,
two project managers,
and one pro<i>gram</i> manager (pear tree optional).&nbsp;
That's a total of fifteen timeslots for interviews.&nbsp;
Suppose also that
your process is Scrum,
with two-week sprints,
starting with
a one-hour planning meeting
first thing Monday morning,
and ending with
a fifteen minute demo
and
a fifteen minute retrospective
last thing Friday afternoon,
plus fifteen minutes of standup each morning.&nbsp;
Furthermore,
the pro<i>ject</i> managers
have a weekly one hour meeting
with the pro<i>gram</i> manager,
even though the developers are not present.&nbsp;
That's 3.75 timeslots occupied by meetings,
bringing the total to 18.75,
which we can round up to one week.&nbsp;
We can add a week of working within your team
so that my engagement includes
the start and end of one sprint,
and I get a much better view of how your team works.&nbsp;
It also lets me
spread the interviews out
for better flexibility.&nbsp;
Or, since I'm flexible on days,
we can stick with just one week,
and start on Wednesday or so
of the <i>second</i> week of a sprint,
so that I can see
that sprint's closeout
and the <i>next</i> one's start.
</p>
-->
<h2>How Much Does It Cost?</h2>

<p>
The price is $20,000 per week,
plus expenses.&nbsp;
There is no limit for remote work,
but I will spend a maximum of
two consecutive weeks,
and 20% of my time,
on travel.
</p>

<h2>What Else Can I Get?</h2>

<p>
After you've had a chance to review the report,
we can discuss whether you want some additional services,
for additional prices we will discuss.&nbsp;
Mainly:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    If I'm available,
    you may ask to have me
    <i>continue</i>,
    including either more interviews and such,
    or working as part of your team,
    including <i>ongoing</i>
    process improvement,
    mentoring (especially of junior developers),
    etc.&nbsp;
    We can do this on a part-time basis,
    retainer,
    or various other arrangements.
  </li>

  <li>
    We can arrange a "check-up" in the future,
    where I will look at any <i>changes</i> in your
    goals, staff, types of projects, technologies, etc.
  </li>

  <li>
    Of course I'm happy to "cross-sell" you on my
    <a href="training">training</a>
    and
    <a href="roadmaps">project roadmapping</a>
    services.&nbsp;
    :-)
  </li>

  <li>
    If there are other add-on services
    you would like,
    we can discuss them then.
  </li>

</ul>

<p>
If there's anything else you need,
or you're ready to submit your inquiry,
go ahead and
<a href="/contact">contact me</a>.
