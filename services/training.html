<p>
I offer training classes,
that I can come to your location to teach,
or do remotely via the Web.&nbsp;
Rather than languages, frameworks, and other common things,
I mainly teach
how to produce high-quality software,
using
<a href="/ACRUMEN">the ACRUMEN Software Quality Definition</a>.&nbsp;
I can also teach on
"modern" software engineering techniques
conducive to quality,
such as

  TDD</a>
/
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development"
   rel="nofollow"
   target="_new">
  BDD</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming"
   rel="nofollow"
   target="_new">
  Pair Programming</a>.
</p>

<p>
These are currently available only in half-day length,
and at premises you arrange,
which must have proper presentation facilities.&nbsp;
Later I may expand these into
full-day or multi-day,
or make them available via webinar,
if there is demand.
</p>

<p>
Pricing, <i>without customization</i>,
is $198 per seat
or a flate rate of $3,398,
plus travel expenses.&nbsp;
There is a minimum of ten and a maximum of twenty students
<i>at this rate</i>.&nbsp;
I'm willing to negotiate about larger classes,
but they will be either much more expensive,
or done much less interactively.&nbsp;
You can have <i>fewer</i> students, but
you'll pay for the extra seats,
and there are
<i>no refunds for no-shows</i>
(regardless of reserved size).
</p>

<p>
If you want me to customize a course
to address your specific needs,
such as having examples in your chosen language,
working up a training class in something else,
or expanding a class into a full day or more,
I can do that... for a price.&nbsp;
Discounts are also available if you want
multiple classes on the same day,
or multiple consecutive full days.
</p>

<p>
Note that just as with all my other on-site services,
classes <i>must</i> be booked for
at least as long as
the required travel
(round-trip, door to door).&nbsp;
At least in this case, you have many options how to put that together.&nbsp;
;-)
</p>

<p>I am also in the process of putting together
downloadable videos, e-books, and other training material
that can be used at your own leisure.&nbsp;
Some will even be <i>free!</i></p>
