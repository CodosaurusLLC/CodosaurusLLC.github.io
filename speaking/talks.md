The talks I am currently pitching include:

- My
[**ACRUMEN**](acrumen)
definition of software quality
(title: "Write Better Software with ACRUMEN").&nbsp;
<!-- This is completely technology-agnostic;
in fact there is not even any code!&nbsp; -->
I can also do this as
a lightning talk
or a keynote.

- [**Mutation testing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
(title: "Kill All Mutants!&nbsp; (Intro to Mutation Testing)").&nbsp;
I have prepared versions with the code in
several programming languages,
and lengths from 20 minutes to a bit over an hour (plus Q&A).

- [**Genetic Algorithms**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
(title: "Tight Genes: Intro to Genetic Algorithms").&nbsp;
Yes I do mean gene<b><i>t</i></b>ic, not gene<b><i>r</i></b>ic!&nbsp;
This one includes lots of code (but not _live_ coding),
currently in Ruby or Python,
but I could certainly translate it into other languages if you want.&nbsp;
I have versions prepared from 30 minutes to 50.

- [**TDD (Test Driven Development)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
(title: "TDD like a Viking: Making Mead with JavaScript!").&nbsp;
This talk describes the benefits and process of TDD,
and walks through several examples
as I develop some helpful calculators
for brewing mead.&nbsp;
There is quite a lot of code,
but it is not _live_-coded.&nbsp;
Unlike most of my talks,
this is _only_ in JavaScript.

- **Ruby "gotchas"**
(title: "Ruby Gotchas").&nbsp;
I have done this for local user groups,
for about 45 minutes.&nbsp;
It details some of the unexpected rough edges of Ruby,
that are contrary to what one might expect,
based on expectations built up by "most other languages",
or common sense.&nbsp;
Unlike most of my talks,
this is _only_ in Ruby.

- [**Ping-Pong Pair Programming**](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/ping-pong-programming/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
(title: "Whose Line of Code Is It Anyway?").&nbsp;
This is a hands-on demo with
a co-speaker _or_
a volunteer from the audience
(or series of them),
working on a problem
and (at polyglot conferences) in a language
both _chosen by the audience_
(from a relatively small set).

- **Making [mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}**
(title: "Drink Like a Chinese Egyptian Ethiopian Filipino Finnish Greek Indian Lithuanian Mayan Nepalese Polish Welsh Xhosa Viking:
the History and Making of MEAD!").&nbsp;
Yes, this is not a technical thing,
at least in the computer sense.&nbsp;
;-)

- **Breaking into conference speaking**
(title: "You Wanna Say Somethin'?").&nbsp;
This includes things like
why you might want to talk at a conference,
how to find the conferences,
how to apply to speak at them,
and a few basic public speaking tips.

- **[Genaver](https://github.com/CodosaurusLLC/Genaver){:target="_new"}**
(title: "Genaver: A Tool for Multi-Talking").&nbsp;
Genaver is a tool I have created
that lets me quickly and easily generate
a version of a presentation
(if it's already in HTML, not PowerPoint, Keynote, etc.),
with various parts chosen
such as
what human-language to use for the introduction,
what _programming_ language to use for any code samples,
whether to use the short, medium, or long
versions of various explanations
(so that the talk can fit in various timeslots),
and so on.&nbsp;
This talk is the story of
how the need came to be,
how I settled on this implementation,
how it works, and
how to use it.&nbsp;
It is suitable mainly for conferences focusing on
kluges, hacks, jury/jerry-rigging, etc.,
such as
[GambiConf](https://gambiconf.dev/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
[!!Con (BangBangCon)](https://bangbangcon.com/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
and
[SIGBOVIK](http://sigbovik.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}.&nbsp;
This is currently written in Portuguese
(as I will do it first at
[GambiConf](https://gambiconf.dev/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
in São Paulo, Brazil),
but I could deliver it in English.

I also have some five-minute "lightning" talks prepared:

- **Why we _prepend_ to lists**, instead of appending,
when using immutable data,
as is used with most "functional" programming languages.

- Five-minute versions of my ACRUMEN, mead, and conference-speaking talks.

<!--
I'm also interested in putting together talks on
doctests (such as in Elixir or Python),
_property-based_ testing,
any other weird dev-testing tricks I find,
ways to ease into TDD/BDD,
helpful TDD/BDD hints,
code smells,
design patterns,
and more.
-->

Want me to speak on something not covered above?&nbsp;
[Ask me](/contact), and we'll see.

Except as noted above,
these are all in English,
but with decent lead time to translate,
I could also do them in French or Portuguese.&nbsp;
(In non-Anglophone countries,
I also do my intro in the local language.&nbsp;
So far, I have done that in
Dutch, Greek, Lithuanian, Polish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, and Swedish.)
