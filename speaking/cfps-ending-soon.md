<center>LAST UPDATED: 2024-01-16</center>

This is a list of CfPs
(Calls for Papers/Presentations/Participation/etc.)
that I know of,
closing within the next two weeks.&nbsp;
It is updated approximately every week
(usually on Tuesday afternoon),
so nothing should fall through the cracks.&nbsp;
It is an extract of a much larger list
that I maintain on behalf of
[Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#accept-only-candid-coders){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}'s
[Speakers Network](https://www.toptal.com/community/speakers){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}.&nbsp;
That one contains past CfPs,
CfPs closing much farther in the future,
and estimates when past ones should reopen.&nbsp;
(If you want access to that, use
[my referral link](https://www.toptal.com/#accept-only-candid-coders){:target="_new"},
click on the “Apply as a Freelancer” button,
pass the screening,
then apply to join the
[Speakers Network](https://www.toptal.com/community/speakers){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
which may require going through their Speakers _Academy_ first.)

This list contains _only_
the CfPs of conferences I am personally interested in,
ones that other
[Speakers Network](https://www.toptal.com/community/speakers){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"} members inform me of,
and a _few_ others I happen to stumble across.&nbsp;
So, that's mainly software development conferences,
focused on Elixir (or Phoenix), Ruby (or Rails), Python, JavaScript, or C,
or not focused on any particular tech stack
(though it may _lean heavily_ towards one or two),
or occasionally testing
(of the kind devs should do to their own code,
not the kind a QA tester does).&nbsp;
It usually omits CfPs from conferences
held in places I won't go,
or focused on any particular
methodology, other field of application, other lines of work, etc.&nbsp;
(I won't even mention them here,
lest it mislead people looking for those.)

If you know of something missing, feel free to
[contact me](/contact){:target="_new"}.&nbsp;
Just please make sure that
the CfP is indeed closing within the next two weeks,
else I might already have it in the _big_ list, just not this _extract_.
