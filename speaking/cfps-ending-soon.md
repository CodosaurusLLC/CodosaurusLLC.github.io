This is a list of CfPs
(Calls for Papers/Presentations/Participation/etc.)
that I know of,
closing within the next 30 days.&nbsp;
It is updated as I add CfPs I find out about,
plus some extra "CfP-hunting"
I do about once a week
(usually on Tuesdays).&nbsp;
There are usually about twenty to forty,
but highly variable.

It is an extract of a much larger list
that I maintain on behalf of
[Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#accept-only-candid-coders){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}'s
[Speakers Network](https://www.toptal.com/community/speakers){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}.&nbsp;
That one contains past CfPs,
CfPs closing much farther in the future,
and estimates when past ones should reopen.&nbsp;
(If you want access to that, use
[my referral link](https://www.toptal.com/#accept-only-candid-coders){:target="_new"},
click on the “Apply as a Freelancer” button,
pass the screening,
then apply to join the
[Speakers Network](https://www.toptal.com/community/speakers){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
which may require going through their Speakers _Academy_ first.)

This list contains _only_
the CfPs of conferences I am personally interested in,
ones that other people
(especially
[Speakers Network](https://www.toptal.com/community/speakers){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
members) tell me about,
and a _few_ others I happen to stumble across.&nbsp;
So, that's mainly software development conferences, focused on:

- Elixir (or Phoenix), Ruby (or Rails), Python, JavaScript, C,
or sometimes closely related things
(like the BEAM or C++),
- or _not_ tightly focused on any particular tech stack
(though it may _lean heavily_ towards one or two), domain, technique,
methodology, etc.,
- or occasionally testing
(of the kind devs should do to their own code,
not the kind a QA tester does).

It usually _omits_ CfPs from conferences:

- whose websites and/or CfPs are not available in some language I speak (English, French, or Portuguese),
- lasting less than a full work-day,
- about any other tech stack or topic,
- tightly focused on various specific subtopics,
- held in places I won't go (mostly repressive countries),
- or that doesn't have a website of its own
(at least about the series).

If you know of something missing, feel free to
[contact me](/contact){:target="_new"}.&nbsp;
Just please make sure that
the CfP is indeed closing within the next 30 days,
else I might already have it in the _big_ list, just not this _extract_.

Donation form coming eventually.&nbsp; ;-)
