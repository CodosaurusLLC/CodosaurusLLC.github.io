I mainly serve
established
American
[SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
companies.&nbsp;
However, you don't _have_ to be one to use my services.&nbsp;
That's just the best fit.

- If you sell your software as a _product_,
or write software for others,
or your main line of work
depends directly in some other way
on software _you write_,
you're probably still a good fit for
all of my services.

- If your main line of work
depends directly in some other way
on software you _outsource_,
you would still be a good fit for
[roadmapping](roadmapping),
to help bidders understand what you need,
and my
[software development](development)
services.

- If you write (or outsource) in-house tools
that just _help_ with your business,
like inventory or appointment management or whatever,
or your company is not yet "established"
(over three years old, or profitable),
then you can still benefit from my
[software development](development) services,
and [roadmapping](roadmapping) for major efforts.&nbsp;
My other services are aimed more at _quality_,
which generally isn't as important for
internal software,
or
ideas still being validated.

So why am I targeting "established American SaaS" companies?&nbsp;

- Companies that are not well established (mainly startups),
need to focus on _speed_ and _idea validation_,
which
[roadmapping](roadmapping)
can help with,
but my other offerings focus mainly on _quality_.&nbsp;
That helps speed in the long run,
but takes a while to have a noticeable effect.

- There is significant additional overhead,
on _both sides_, to
dealing with foreign companies.&nbsp;
For a very profitable contract,
I might jump through the hoops,
but I'm certainly not _chasing_ that market.

- And lastly, SaaS is the space I know best.
