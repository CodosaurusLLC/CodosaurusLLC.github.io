I mainly serve
established
American
[SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
companies.&nbsp;
However, you don't _have_ to be one to use my services.&nbsp;
That's just the best fit.

- If your company is not yet "established"
(over three years old, or profitable),
you can benefit mainly from my
[software development](development) services.&nbsp;

- If you sell your software as a _product_,
or write software for others,
or your main line of work
depends directly in some other way
on software you write,
you're probably still a good fit for
all of my services.

- If your main line of work
depends directly in some other way
on software you _outsource_,
you would still be a good fit for
[roadmapping](roadmapping),
to help bidders understand what you need.

- If you write (or outsource) in-house tools
that just _help_ with your business,
like inventory or appointment management or whatever,
then you can still benefit from my
[software development](development) services,
and maybe [roadmapping](roadmapping) for major efforts.&nbsp;
My other services are aimed more at _quality_,
which generally isn't as important for _this_ software.

So why am I targeting "established American SaaS" companies?&nbsp;

- Companies that are not well established (mainly startups),
need to focus on _speed_ and _idea validation_,
which
[roadmapping](roadmapping)
can help with,
but my other offerings focus mainly on _quality_.&nbsp;
That helps speed in the long run,
but takes a while to have a noticeable effect.

- There is significant additional overhead,
on _both sides_, to
dealing with foreign companies.&nbsp;
For a very profitable contract,
I might jump through the hoops,
but I'm certainly not _chasing_ that market.

- And lastly, SaaS is the space I know best.
