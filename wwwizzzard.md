Give WWWizzzard a URL to check, and tell it how often.&nbsp;
<!--
(Choices include 1-24 hours, 1-7 days, 1-5 weeks, or 1-12 months.)&nbsp;
-->
When it detects a change<sup>1</sup>,
you get an email including the changes.&nbsp;
And you get 31 checks (total) per month for _free_,
with more for a mere one cent (US) each _or less!_<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;
Never miss another sale, concert, CfP, etc.!

<p style="display: none" why="not sure if I wanna include this much text">
Features already working in the command-line Proof-of-Concept include:
- Basic change detection and reporting
- Follow redirects _and refreshes_
- Ignore changes in whitespace, including linebreaks
- Ignore parts matching some selector
- Ignore a site until a specified date
- Include (and check for changes in) names of external files

Other planned features include:
- Report only additions, omitting removals and old versions from changes
- Check only parts matching some selector
- Checking contents of element options, and inline scripts, CSS, etc.
- Notification by SMS (for an extra cost)
- Checking contents of external files (for an extra cost)
</p>

Sound good to you?&nbsp;
Give me your email address to be notified when it's ready!&nbsp;
Also feel free to send feedback on the whole idea,
to wiz-{{ "now" | date: "%Y" }} at this domain.&nbsp;
(Sorry not to put it all together for you,
but I get quite enough spam already!)

<sup>1</sup> Not all changes will be detectable.&nbsp;
In particular, WWWizzzard will _not_ execute JavaScript,
which may affect the site's final contents,
maybe all of it.&nbsp;
Nor will WWWizzzard check the applied styles,
nor the contents of inline scripts/styles
nor of external files
such as scripts, images, CSS, etc.&nbsp;
Such things _may_ be available later,
as an option,
incurring additional checking costs per external file.
