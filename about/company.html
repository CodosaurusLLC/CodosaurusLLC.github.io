title: The Company

<p>
The home page tells the main story,
but you probably want a little more history,
the <i>when</i> and <i>why</i> of the company.
</p>

<p>
I started Codosaurus, LLC
in April 1990,
as TIDMADT Enterprises,
named after the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  dialup BBS (Bulletin Board System)</a>
I had been running for a few years.&nbsp;
(That name in turn stands for
These Initials Don't Mean A Damn Thing.)&nbsp;
Since then, it has also been
Aronson Consulting Enterprises,
Aronson Programming Enterprises,
and
Dave Aronson Software Engineering and Training.&nbsp;
(I also renamed the BBS, to Air 'n Sun.)
</p>

<p>
Why did I start the company?&nbsp;
Having been laid off a few times,
I wanted to
at least have a better idea
when I would be out of work,
so I decided to try independent consulting.
</p>

<p>
That didn't work very well.&nbsp;
First,
I only had five years of industry experience,
which wasn't much in the consulting world,
at least back then.&nbsp;
Second,
this was pre-Web,
so neither I nor work were so easily findable
--
and
as an introvert,
I was absolutely <i>horrible</i> at marketing!&nbsp;
Third,
I knew next to nothing about <i>business!</i>&nbsp;
I lived mostly off savings for two years,
doing mostly IT-support work
rather than the
<i>software development</i> work
I really wanted,
and went back to the "real job" world,
with occasional
consulting projects
in my spare time
and between "permanent" positions.
</p>

<p>
Fast forward to 2011.&nbsp;
At work,
I wanted more choice in
what projects I worked on,
what training I could go to,
etc.,
especially to learn and use
modern skills with a bright future.&nbsp;
Also, the prospect of often
working <i>from home</i>
was enticing.
</p>

<p>
Unlike in 1990,
there was now
this wonderful thing called
the World Wide Web!&nbsp;
I already had
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davearonson/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  a profile on LinkedIn</a>
and
the major job boards.&nbsp;
Recruiters had already been
contacting me in droves,
sometimes with
jobs <i>or consulting projects</i>
I would have taken.
</p>

<p>
So, I started freelancing seriously again.&nbsp;
I started
<a href="http://blog.codosaur.us/" target: "_new" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  a blog</a>, 
to get more exposure and credibility,
threw up a company web site,
learned more about
business topics like
contracts and taxes and <i>marketing</i> and so on,
and hung my proverbial shingle back out.
</p>

<p>
It's been going <i>much</i> better this time!&nbsp;
I'm now making more money
(at least before the higher taxes)
than at my previous "real" job --
and with
more freedom,
more variety,
the training I want,
and
usually <i>no commuting</i>.&nbsp;
I've established a "real company" --
as an LLC,
not fully incorporated as an C-Corp or S-Corp.&nbsp;
(For a <i>very</i> good opportunity,
I <i>might</i> consider
jumping through those hoops.)
</p>

<p>
Since then,
I've recognized that my
uniqueness among developers
is the emphasis I've always placed on
the <i>quality</i> of my software,
and my ability to <i>explain</i> things.&nbsp;
So, I've expanded my service offerings,
and am trying to "pivot"
into a niche,
by shifting my primary focus away from coding
to roadmapping, training, and other forms of <i>advice</i>.&nbsp;
In other words, more true <i>consulting</i>,
rather than being simply another
<i>contractor</i>
or a
<i>freelance</i> developer.&nbsp;
That's why my "job subtitle" has gone from
"freelance developer"
to
"consulting software developer"
to
"software development consultant".
