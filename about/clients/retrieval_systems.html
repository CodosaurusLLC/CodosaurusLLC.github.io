<h3>Who are they?</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://retsys.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  Retrieval Systems</a>,
based in Vienna, Virginia, USA,
provides software engineering services to the
publishing, document management, and other information-based industries.
</p>

<h3>What did I do, when, where?</h3>

<p>
I have done work for
<a href="http://retsys.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  Retrieval Systems</a>
on and off from 2012 to 2014,
starting onsite and then being allowed to work remotely via their VPN.&nbsp;
One of the things they usually provide for their clients,
is a separate application for
administrative maintenance of the database tables.&nbsp;
Mostly I fixed minor bugs and added features
(such as new columns,
and drawing the choices for a column from some other table)
to a few of their table maintenance apps.&nbsp;
Also I advised the company's President / General Counsel,
and assorted software development staff,
on techniques such as
pair programming, test-driven development, and Agile project management.
