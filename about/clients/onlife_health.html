<h3>Who are they?</h3>

<p><a href="https://onlifehealth.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  Onlife Health</a>,
based in Brentwood, Tennessee, USA, is a
health and wellness company.&nbsp;
Their clients are
insurance carriers,
who insure
employees of
<i>their</i> client companies.&nbsp;
Onlife offers those employees ("members") services such as
advice, health assessments,
help setting and tracking health-related goals,
and one-on-one coaching.</p>

<h3>What did I do, when, where?</h3>

<p>I worked there,
in a staff-augmentation role on their team,
from March to September 2014,
100% remotely (as did about half the people),
via <a href="http://www.ravetec.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  RaveTec</a>.&nbsp;
Specifically, I worked on the
coach-facing section of their portal,
adding features,
fixing bugs,
reviewing code,
helping define/refine the processes,
documenting things,
etc.&nbsp;
For instance, I:

<ul>

  <li>
    Added multi-selectability to the filters on the coaches' caseload lists
  </li>

  <li>
    Added and fixed filters there
  </li>

  <li>
    Added the ability for the coach to
    order nicotine replacement therapy materials
    (including exporting the order to the fulfillment center)
  </li>

  <li>
    Made it show the coach the name of the group a calling member belongs to
    (integrating with the Avaya phone system via SOAP)
  </li>

  <li>
    Made it close out a member's courses and goals
    when they opt out of the coaching program
  </li>

  <li>
    Made it preserve basic formatting of multi-paragraph text
  </li>

  <li>
    Fixed a race condition between the coach caseload item
    insertion and deletion of Resque background jobs
  </li>

  <li>
    Fixed many timezone based problems plaguing the widely distributed team
  </li>

  <li>
    Tweaked various UI bits so that users could not enter data
    that would cause problems
  </li>

  <li>
    Centralized documentation on how to set up a development environment
    (there were <i>several</i> OLH-specific programs that needed to be running,
    and a few add-ons like Rabbit and Resque)
  </li>

  <li>
    Documented how to navigate via the parent company's VPN
    to the required compliance training
  </li>

  <li>
    Introduced the use of
    <a href="http://screencast.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">Jing</a>
    for demos of bug fixes and new features,
    making QA approval and the end-of-sprint demo a breeze
    (QA had already been using it, but only to make screencasts of bugs)
  </li>

</ul>

and much more.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, since my work was all on the <i>coach-facing</i> part, I
can't show you my work products in action, unless you get them to hire you as a
coach!&nbsp; ;-)</p>


<h3>What did they say?</h3>

<div class="quote">I worked with Dave while at Onlife Health.&nbsp; He always
  was impressive with his knowledge of Development.&nbsp; It took him very
  little time to be a contributing member of the team despite being 100%
  remote.</div>
