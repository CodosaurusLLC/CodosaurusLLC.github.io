<h3>Who are they?</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.department13.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  Department 13</a>,
based in McLean, Virginia, USA,
"delivers innovative technological solutions that
transform military, intelligence, and law enforcement operations.&nbsp;
[...]&nbsp;
[They] apply [their] unrivalled expertise in Software, Electronics, and
RF Exploitation to change the face of strategic and tactical operations."
</p>

<h3>What did I do, when, where?</h3>

<p>
I worked on a project for them in March and April of 2012,
fully remotely except for a few meetings within easy driving distance.&nbsp;
The purpose of the project was to demonstrate what could be done with
the data from a technique they had developed for tracking the whereabouts of
certain devices.&nbsp;
What sort of devices, and how they track them, I am not at liberty to say.
</p>

<p>
To accomplish this, I created a single-page application
in pure hand-rolled JavaScript,
using a few features of HTML5 and the Google Maps API.&nbsp;
It included features such as:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    Let the user designate which devices are "of interest", via unique IDs
  </li>

  <li>
    Use a slider to move back and forth through time
  </li>

  <li>
    Use buttons to move back and forth through time, event by event,
    paying attention only to events that involve a "device of interest"
  </li>

  <li>
    Show the current location, and "tracks", of each "device of interest"
  </li>

  <li>
    Zoom the map in and out, see which devices were in the current area
    at a given time, tag any subset of them as being "of interest",
    or see only which "devices of interest" are in the area
  </li>

  <li>
    Show which devices were associated with any set of certain key locations,
    and vice-versa, allowing the user to apply this association repeatedly
  </li>

  <li>
    Show how any given device or key location is related to another device
    or key location, via such associations
  </li>

  <li>
    Optionally, automatically zoom in/out to include all
    current locations and tracks
  </li>

</ul>

<p>
I also participated in brainstorming sessions and other meetings,
about possibilities such as creating a

plug-in to exploit this data.
