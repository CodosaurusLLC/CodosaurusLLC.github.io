<h3>Who are they?</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.send2fax.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">Send2Fax</a>
is a service that lets users send and receive faxes via email and the web.&nbsp;
They are now part of
<a href="http://www.j2.com" rel="nofollow" target="_new">j2 Cloud Services.</a>
</p>

<h3>What did I do, when, where?</h3>

<p>
In August of 2003, I created a program for them to initialize and test
a Brooktrout TR114 fax board.&nbsp;
I also configured their Windows 2000 Server
to run the program upon startup.&nbsp;
The work only took about ten hours, and was 100% remote.&nbsp;
I wrote it in C (yes, plain old C, not C++, C#, nor Objective-C),
which was my primary language at that time.
