<p>
I mainly serve
established
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service"
   rel="nofollow" target="_new">
  SaaS</a>
companies.&nbsp;
However, you don't <i>have</i> to be one
to use my services.&nbsp;
That's just the best fit.</p>

<ul>

  <p><li>If you
    sell your software as a product,
    or
    write software for others,
    you're probably still a good fit for
    <a href="/services">all of my services</a>.&nbsp;
    (Especially software contractors who
    make fixed bids
    or
    work on US DoD projects.)
  </li></p>

  <p><li>
    If you're a SaaS company
    but not "established"
    (in business for at least three years,
    or turning a profit,
    ideally both),
    you can still benefit from
    <a href="/services/roadmaps">my roadmapping service</a>.&nbsp;
    Startups need to focus on <i>speed</i> and <i>idea validation</i>,
    which
    <a href="/services/roadmaps">roadmapping</a>
    can help with,
    while my other offerings focus mainly on <i>quality</i>.
  </li></p>

  <p><li>
    If your main line of work
    depends directly in some other way
    on software you write (or outsource),
    you <i>might</i> still be a good fit,
    especially for
    <a href="/services/roadmaps">my roadmapping service</a>.
  </li></p>

  <p><li>
    If you write (or outsource) in-house tools
    that just <i>help</i> with your business,
    like inventory or appointment management or whatever,
    then probably not...
    but if you still think so, we can discuss it.
  </li></p>
