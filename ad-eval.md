I will evaluate your advertisements,
mainly for technical positions,
other positions,
business services,
or products used by businesses.

The _normal_ fee,
when you _explicitly ask me_ to evaluate your ad,
is US$1 per word.

If you engage this service by sending me an ad for an
[inappropriate job](bad-jobs),
or any products or services,
the fee is much more.&nbsp;
See the
[inappropriate job](bad-jobs)
page for further details.

I will tell you what was good or bad about your ad,
and make appropriate suggestions.&nbsp;
Note, however, that I have
no expertise nor experience
in the advertising industry,
so I _suggest_ that you do not engage this service...
though I will gladly _accept_ such engagements.

Payment is due
one calendar month after my reply,
with a late-fee of
1.5% per calendar month, non-compounded.
