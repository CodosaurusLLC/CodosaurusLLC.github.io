I will discuss with you,
and maybe discuss with your team and observe your meetings,
to determine the current and desired situations,
and what
tools, techniques, processes, etc.
would be most effective
to bridge that gap
within a reasonable budget.&nbsp;
This will help your team work _efficiently_,
rather than being hobbled by
an inefficient process,
bad tools,
etc.&nbsp;
Yes, it's a bad craftsman who blames his tools...
but a good craftsman will still do better with good tools
(and techniques and processes).

It comes in three basic sizes,
as follows:

- Hour:&nbsp;
  We discuss it alone,
  remotely,
  for one hour,
  and you get no report.&nbsp;
  This costs $499 for the first hour,
  and $399 for each further hour.

- Day:&nbsp;
  Mainly, we discuss it
  over the course of a work-day,
  in several stretches.&nbsp;
  In this case "we" means
  myself plus you,
  _or_ another person you designate
  (who may be different per stretch),
  or both.&nbsp;
  You may also have me attend some _meetings_.&nbsp;
  Within a week, you get a brief report with recommendations.&nbsp;
  This costs $4,999 for the first day,
  and $3,999 for each further day.&nbsp;
  (For the duration of the COVID pandemic, this is remote-only.&nbsp;
  When COVID is no more,
  I could come to your office,
  but you'd also have to pay my travel expenses,
  and all travel-related time would count towards the time spent.)

- Week:&nbsp;
  As above,
  each work-day of a work-week,
  except that you may have me talk to
  _two_ other people at a time without you.&nbsp;
  Within two weeks, you get a _more detailed_ report.&nbsp;
  This costs $23,999 for the first week,
  and $17,999 for each further week.

You may also have me actually _join your team_
as a software developer
for some number of weeks,
so as to
"lead by example"
and/or
see your situation from the inside.&nbsp;
(See above re COVID versus expenses.)&nbsp;
This also costs $23,999 for the first week,
and $17,999 for each further week.&nbsp;
Doing this on a full-time or on-site basis
is limited to two weeks,
but this is also available for
up to ten weeks
as _remote_ and _half_-time,
for $10,999 for the first week and $7,999 for each further week.

Afterward, if you like,
we can also arrange recurring "checkups",
or
[training](training) for your developers,
or discuss other ideas for further services.

If there's anything else you need,
or you're ready to submit your inquiry,
go ahead and
[contact me](contact).
