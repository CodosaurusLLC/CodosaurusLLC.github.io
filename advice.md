I will discuss with you,
and maybe discuss with your team and observe your meetings,
to determine the current and desired situations,
and what
tools, techniques, processes, etc.
would be most effective
to bridge that gap
within a reasonable budget.&nbsp;
This will help your team work _efficiently_,
rather than being hobbled by
an inefficient process,
bad tools,
etc.&nbsp;
Yes, it's a bad craftsman who blames his tools...
but a good craftsman will still do better with good tools
(and techniques and processes).

It comes in three basic sizes,
as follows:

- Hour:&nbsp;
  We (you and I) discuss it alone,
  remotely,
  for one hour,
  and you get no report.&nbsp;
  This costs $498.

- Day:&nbsp;
  Mainly, we discuss it
  over the course of a work-day,
  in several stretches,
  and within a week,
  you get a fairly _brief_ report with recommendations.&nbsp;
  In this case "we" means
  myself plus you,
  _or_ another person you designate
  (who may be different per stretch),
  or both.&nbsp;
  You may also have me attend some _meetings_.&nbsp;
  This costs $3,998,
  plus travel expenses,
  and travel time counts.

- Week:&nbsp;
  As above,
  each work-day of a work-week,
  except that you may have me talk to
  _two_ other people at a time without you.&nbsp;
  Within two weeks, you get a _more detailed_ report.&nbsp;
  This costs $18,998,
  plus travel expenses,
  and travel time counts.

Each of these can be had in multiples,
with a discount
_if_ arranged in advance.

You may also have me actually _join your team_
as a software developer
for some number of weeks,
so as to
"lead by example"
and/or
see your situation from the inside.&nbsp;
This costs the same as the above.&nbsp;
Doing this on a full-time or on-site basis
is limited to two weeks.

Afterward, if you like,
we can also arrange recurring "checkups",
or
[training](training) for your developers,
or discuss other ideas for further services.

If there's anything else you need,
or you're ready to submit your inquiry,
go ahead and
[contact me](contact).
