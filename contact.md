Sorry, I'm still transitioning this web site
from being a Rails app to Github pages.&nbsp;
So, the old stuff I had with Rails mailers won't work any more,
and I haven't yet found a good form processor.&nbsp;
That leaves these options:

- Send email to T.Rex-{{ "now" | date: "%Y" }} at this domain.&nbsp;
That should be good until the year after next,
at which point it should get shut off.&nbsp;
Sorry not to make it a nice convenient mailto link,
but I get enough spam already thankyouverymuch.

- If you're not just telemarketing, call me at 571-308-6622.

- Lastly, I can also be reached via Skype.&nbsp;
However, don't usually have the app going,
so you'll have to arrange it in advance.
