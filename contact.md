- Send email to T.Rex-{{ "now" | date: "%Y" }} at this domain.&nbsp;
That should be good for a few years,
at which point it should get shut off.&nbsp;
(At that time, just update the year.)&nbsp;
Sorry not to make it a nice convenient
form or mailto link,
but I get enough spam already thankyouverymuch.

- You can contact me on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/DaveAronson/){:target="_new"}
or
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/DaveAronson){:target="_new"}.

- If you're not just telemarketing, call me at +1-571-308-6622.&nbsp;
However, I usually have "Silence Unknown Callers" turned on,
and if you call multiple times without leaving a message,
I may ass-u-me you're a persistent scammer and block your number.

- You can send me snailmail at
3683 Blenheim Blvd., Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.

- Lastly, I can also be reached via
the usual real-time video-chat apps.&nbsp;
However, don't usually have them going,
so you'll have to arrange it in advance.
