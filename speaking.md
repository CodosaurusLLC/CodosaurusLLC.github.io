title: Speaking
---

I enjoy presenting at conferences, primarily in person
at interesting destinations.&nbsp;
(I could be talked into doing a remote conference too,
mainly within three timezones of the eastern USA.)&nbsp;
Mainly, I like technology-agnostic software development conferences,
or about some language I know and like, such as Ruby or Elixir.&nbsp;
Even if your conference is about some language I don't know or don't like,
if there's enough language-agnostic content,
or I really want to see the location,
I might go for it.&nbsp;
Some of my topics are also appropriate for _testing_ conferences.

The topics I _currently_ have talks prepared for are:

- <span class="big bold">My
[**ACRUMEN**](/ACRUMEN)
definition of software quality.</span>&nbsp;
This is completely technology-agnostic; in fact there is not even any code!&nbsp;
I have presented full-length talks on this at
six conferences and
assorted Washington DC area Meetups,
gave five-minute "lightning" talks on it at a couple other conferences,
and discussed it on a podcast.&nbsp;

- [**Mutation testing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing){:class="big bold"}.&nbsp;
I have presented full-length talks on this at
seven conferences and a remote Meetup,
and discussed it on two podcasts.&nbsp;
I'm also slated to give a full-length talk on it at 
[WeAreDevelopers World Congress](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/events/world-congress/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"} 2021.&nbsp;

all due to the COVID pandemic.)&nbsp; -->
There is some code in this, not much and fairly simple,
mainly brief snippets to test, mutations of it, and tests.&nbsp;
<!-- As you may have guessed, -->
I have prepared versions of this in
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
JavaScript,
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
and language-agnostic pseudocode.&nbsp;
The best videos are
[the 39-minute one from RubyConf 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GId6mFL0_c){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
and
[the 22-minute one from JSConf Hawai'i 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNMBOj7JUPs){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}.

- <span class="big bold">Ruby "gotchas"</span>,
i.e., nasty surprises in the
Ruby programming language.&nbsp;
I spoke about that in assorted Washington DC area Ruby Meetups in 2014.&nbsp;
Sorry, no video, but it would normally be about 45 minutes.

- <span class="big bold">Breaking into conference speaking</span>.&nbsp;
I haven't actually done this one at conferences,
or anywhere else that recorded it,
but I have the bare bones prepped as a 5-7 minute
[Toastmasters](http://toastmasters.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
speech,
and intend to fill it out to 30-45 minutes for conferences.

I'm also interested in putting together talks on
Elixir doctests,
_property-based_ testing,
and perhaps one on both property _and_ mutation testing,
plus any other weird testing tricks I find.

Want me to speak on something not covered above?
Ask me, and we'll see.
