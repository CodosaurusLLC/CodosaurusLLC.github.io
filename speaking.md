I enjoy presenting at conferences,
mainly held in person at interesting destinations,
that aren't a royal PITA to get to,
and reimbursing my travel expenses.&nbsp;
(I generally do not do _remote_ conferences,
unless they are within three timezones of US-East.)&nbsp;
I will also talk to a _company_
(or their devs),
for a fee (plus all expenses).
