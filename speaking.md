{% comment %}
I enjoy presenting at conferences, primarily in person
(though I could be talked into doing a remote conference too).
Mainly, I like technology-agnostic software development conferences,
or about some language I know and like, such as Ruby or Elixir.
Even if your conference is about some language I don't know or don't like,
if there's enough language-agnostic content,
or I really want to see the location,
I might go for it.
Some of my topics are also appropriate for _testing_ conferences.

The topics I _currently_ have talks prepared for are:

- Ruby "gotchas";

I spoke about that in assorted Washington DC area Ruby Meetups in 2014

- and breaking into conference speaking.

I'm also interested in putting together talks on _property-based_ testing,
and perhaps one on both that _and_ mutation testing,
plus any other weird testing tricks I find.
