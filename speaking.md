title: Speaking
---

I enjoy presenting at conferences, primarily in person
at interesting destinations.&nbsp;
(I could be talked into doing a remote conference too,
mainly within three timezones of the eastern USA.)&nbsp;
Mainly, I like technology-agnostic software development conferences,
or about some language I know and like, such as Ruby or Elixir.&nbsp;
Even if your conference is about some language I don't know or don't like,
if there's enough language-agnostic content,
or I really want to see the location,
I might go for it.&nbsp;
Some of my topics are also appropriate for _testing_ conferences.&nbsp;
I could also be talking into speaking to a _company_,
or their devs,
for a reasonable fee.

The topics I _currently_ have talks prepared for are:

- <span class="big bold">My
[**ACRUMEN**](/ACRUMEN)
definition of software quality</span>
(title: "Write Better Software with ACRUMEN"):&nbsp;
This is completely technology-agnostic; in fact there is not even any code!&nbsp;
I have presented full-length talks on this at
several conferences
and other such events.

- [**Mutation testing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing){:class="big bold"}
(title: "Kill All Mutants!&nbsp; (Intro to Mutation Testing)"):&nbsp;
There is some code in this, not much and fairly simple,
mainly brief snippets to test, mutations of it, and tests.&nbsp;
I have prepared versions with code in
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
JavaScript,
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
and language-agnostic pseudocode.&nbsp;
I have presented full-length talks on this at
several conferences,
and discussed it on podcasts.

- <span class="big bold">Ruby "gotchas"</span>
(title: "Ruby Gotchas"):&nbsp;
i.e., nasty surprises in the
Ruby programming language.

- <span class="big bold">Ping-Pong Pair Programming</span>
(title: "Whose Line of Code Is It Anyway?"):&nbsp;
a hands-on demo with
a co-speaker _or_
a volunteer from the audience
(or series of them),
working on a problem and in a language
both chosen by the audience.

- <span class="big bold">Breaking into conference speaking</span>
(title: "Speak to the World!"):&nbsp;
I haven't actually done this one at conferences,
or anywhere else that recorded it,
but I have the bare bones prepped as a 5-7 minute
[Toastmasters](http://toastmasters.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
speech,
and intend to fill it out to 30-45 minutes for conferences.&nbsp;
Intended content includes
why you might want to talk at a conference,
how to find the conferences,
how to apply to speak at them,
and a few basic public speaking tips.

- <span class="big bold">Making [mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}</span>
(title: "Drink Like a Chinese Egyptian Ethiopian Filipino Finnish Greek Indian Lithuanian Mayan Nepalese Polish Welsh Xhosa Viking:
the History and Making of MEAD!"):&nbsp;
Yes, this is not a technical thing,
at least in the computer sense.&nbsp;
This talk will be presented at the MWM RG in 2022,
having been prepared for the 2021 one that was canceled.

I'm also interested in putting together talks on
doctests (such as in Elixir or Python),
_property-based_ testing,
any other weird dev-testing tricks I find,
ways to ease into TDD/BDD,
helpful TDD/BDD hints,
and more.

Want me to speak on something not covered above?&nbsp;
Ask me, and we'll see.

Speaking engagements in the _past_ include:

_Likely_ engagements in the next couple years or so,
mainly because I was chosen
but the conference was canceled
(or moved online too many timezones away,
or various other reasons),
include:

| Conference || Topic(s) |

Also, I was one of the co-organizers of
[TDDConf](https://tddconf.com/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
2021,
the very first
international test-driven development conference,
and appeared briefly on-screen
to introduce speakers and fill time.&nbsp;
I was also the <i>sole</i> organizer of Ruby DAYCamp 2013,
an "overflow" event for those who couldn't get into Ruby DCamp
(defunct, site gone).
