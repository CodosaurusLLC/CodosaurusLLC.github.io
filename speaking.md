{% comment %}
I enjoy presenting at conferences, primarily in person
(though I could be talked into doing a remote conference too).
Mainly, I like technology-agnostic software development conferences,
or about some language I know and like, such as Ruby or Elixir.
Even if your conference is about some language I don't know or don't like,
if there's enough language-agnostic content,
or I really want to see the location,
I might go for it.
Some of my topics are also appropriate for _testing_ conferences.

The topics I _currently_ have talks prepared for are:

- My [**ACRUMEN**](/ACRUMEN){:class="big"} definition of software quality;

- <span class="big">Ruby "gotchas"</span>, i.e., nasty surprises in the [Ruby programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new":};
{% comment %}
I spoke about that in assorted Washington DC area Ruby Meetups in 2014

- and <span class="big">breaking into conference speaking</span>.

I'm also interested in putting together talks on
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new":} doctests,
_property-based_ testing,
and perhaps one on both property _and_ mutation testing,
plus any other weird testing tricks I find.

Want me to speak on something not covered above?
Ask me, and we'll see.
