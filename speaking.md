title: Speaking
---

I enjoy presenting at conferences,
mainly
<!-- technology-agnostic software development conferences,
or about some language I know and like such as Ruby or Elixir, -->
held in person at interesting destinations,
and reimbursing my travel expenses.&nbsp;
(I generally do not do _remote_ conferences,
unless they are within three timezones of US-East.)&nbsp;
I will also talk to a _company_
(or their devs)
for an additional fee.

The topics I _currently_ have full-length talks prepared for are:

- My
[**ACRUMEN**](acrumen)
definition of software quality
(title: "Write Better Software with ACRUMEN").&nbsp;
<!-- This is completely technology-agnostic;
in fact there is not even any code!&nbsp;
I have presented on this at
several conferences
and other such events,
from ten minutes to two and a half hours,
usually 30-45.&nbsp; -->
I can also do this as
a lightning talk
or a keynote.

- [**Mutation testing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing)
(title: "Kill All Mutants!&nbsp; (Intro to Mutation Testing)").&nbsp;
<!-- There is some code in this, not much and fairly simple,
mainly brief snippets to test, mutations of it, and tests.&nbsp; -->
I have prepared versions so far with the code in
<!--
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
JavaScript,
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"},
and language-agnostic pseudocode.&nbsp;
-->
several languages,
and have presented on this at many conferences<!--,
from twenty minutes to a full hour, soon an hour and a half-->.&nbsp;

- **Ruby "gotchas"**
(title: "Ruby Gotchas").&nbsp;
<!-- I.e., nasty surprises in the
Ruby programming language.&nbsp; -->
I have done this for local user groups, for about 45 minutes.

- **Ping-Pong Pair Programming**
(title: "Whose Line of Code Is It Anyway?").&nbsp;
This is a hands-on demo with
a co-speaker _or_
a volunteer from the audience
(or series of them),
working on a problem
and (at polyglot conferences) in a language
both _chosen by the audience_.

- **Breaking into conference speaking**
(title: "You Wanna Say Somethin'?").&nbsp;
<!--I haven't actually done this one at conferences,
or anywhere else that recorded it,
but I have the bare bones prepped as a 5-7 minute
[Toastmasters](http://toastmasters.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
speech,
and intend to fill it out to 30-45 minutes for conferences.&nbsp;
Intended content --> This includes things like
why you might want to talk at a conference,
how to find the conferences,
how to apply to speak at them,
and a few basic public speaking tips.

- **Making [mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}**
(title: "Drink Like a Chinese Egyptian Ethiopian Filipino Finnish Greek Indian Lithuanian Mayan Nepalese Polish Welsh Xhosa Viking:
the History and Making of MEAD!").&nbsp;
Yes, this is not a technical thing,
at least in the computer sense.&nbsp;
;-)

I also have a _lightning_ talk prepared on
why we _prepend_ to lists, instead of appending,
when using immutable data.&nbsp;
I'm also interested in putting together talks on
doctests (such as in Elixir or Python),
_property-based_ testing,
any other weird dev-testing tricks I find,
ways to ease into TDD/BDD,
helpful TDD/BDD hints,
and more.

Want me to speak on something not covered above?&nbsp;
[Ask me](/contact), and we'll see.

Definite speaking engagements in the _future_ include:

_Likely_ engagements in the next couple years or so,
mainly because I was chosen
but the conference was canceled
or postponed
(or moved online too many timezones away,
or various other reasons),
include:

Also, I was one of the co-organizers of
[TDDConf](https://tddconf.com/){:rel="nofollow" target="_new"}
2021,
the very first
international test-driven development conference,
and appeared briefly on-screen
to introduce speakers and fill time.&nbsp;
I was also the <i>sole</i> organizer of Ruby DAYCamp (no website) 2013,
a semi-impromptu "overflow" event for those who couldn't get into Ruby DCamp
(defunct, site gone).
