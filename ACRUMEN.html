<p>Long story short,
the
<span style="background: yellow">ACRUMEN</span>
Software Quality Framework
is a simple list of
briefly-named and easily-understood aspects
that I believe
completely cover the subject of
software quality.&nbsp;
Put briefly, they are that software should be:</p>

<table class="acrumen-table">
  <tr>
    <td>Appropriate:&nbsp;</td>
    <td>doing the right job (what the stakeholders need)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Correct:&nbsp;</td>
    <td>doing the job right (i.e., correctly)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Robust:&nbsp;</td>
    <td>hard to make it "misbehave"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Usable:&nbsp;</td>
    <td>easy for users to use</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Maintainable:&nbsp;</td>
    <td>easy for developers to change</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Efficient:&nbsp;</td>
    <td>using resources efficiently</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>So what does the <b style="background: yellow">N</b> stand for?&nbsp;
<b>N</b>othing, I just tacked it on to make a real word!&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<p>And why all this <span style="background: yellow">yellow</span>?!&nbsp;
I said acrumen was a real word, but I didn't say it was English!&nbsp;
It's a Latin word, meaning sour fruit,
such as grapefruit, limes, and of course especially lemons.&nbsp;
So, lemon yellow is the official color of the 
<span style="background: yellow">ACRUMEN</span>
Software Quality Framework.

<p>More explanation will be coming here eventually.&nbsp;
